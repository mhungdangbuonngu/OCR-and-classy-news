"BIDV and Agribank will sell gold to retail consumers “without profit” to stabilize its
prices, representatives for the state-owned lenders have said.

BIDV will start selling bullion at its counters in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City on June

(SBY).

Itwill later expand sales to other localities like Da Nang City, Can Tho City and Ba Ria

The prices would depend on the central bank’s prices, and the goal is to narrow the

gap between domestic and international rates, Lam said.

Agribank CEO Pham Toan Vuong said there would measures in place to verify buyers

identities and prevent money laundering.

A representative of another state-owned lender told VnExpress earlier that the bank

would sell gold within the price band allowed by the central bank.

The SBY allows unrestricted sales to individuals but prohibits sales to businesses and

organizations, he added.

On Thursday it had said it would stop auctioning bullion to and would instead sell to

the four state-owned lenders who would in turn sell in the retail market.

The nine auctions it held in recent weeks have not resulted in narrowing the gap

between domestic and international rates.

"Economists expect Thursday's inflation report to confirm January was
something of a setback in the battle against rapid price increases.

Inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index,
likely rose 0.3% in January from December, according to a survey of economists
by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal. That's up from the 0.2%
increase in December. Core inflation, which excludes prices for food and energy,
is expected to double the 0.2% increase of December.

If those predictions hold, the report would likely confirm the signal from a
different measure of inflation—the Consumer Price Index—which earlier this
month showed that inflation is proving more stubborn than policymakers at the
Federal Reserve had hoped.

PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, and as of late has
been trending closer to the central bank's goal of 2% annualized inflation.

""Itis the PCE and core PCE inflation rates, and not the CPI inflation measures,
that will determine the timing and frequency of future Fed rate cuts,"" wrote
BMO's Scott Anderson. ""Unfortunately, we expect a similar performance of
these measures as in the January CPI report.

"Sales of newly built single-family homes ticked up in January, the Census
Bureau said Monday.

New homes sold at an annual rate of 661,000, a 1.5% increase from December,
but below the 680,000 forecasters expected, according to a survey of
economists by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal. [21

The rate was 1.8% higher than a year ago but was 3.5% lower than the average
in 2019 pre-pandemic. Like the market for existing homes, sales of newly built
houses have been bogged down by high mortgage rates that have put home
purchases out of reach for many buyers.

‘A downtick in mortgage rates earlier this winter could help improve the
situation going forward, Ryan Sweet, Chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics,
wrote in a commentary.

The average rate offered for a 30-year mortgage hovered in the high 6% range in
January after hitting 7.79% in late October, according to Freddie Mac.
Furthermore, the roaring job market has kept potential buyers in good financial
shape.

 

“The outlook for new-home sales remains cautiously optimistic as the 30-year
fixed mortgage rate is off its recent peak, job growth is strong, and inventories
are not problematic for the new-home market,” he wrote.

prices have therefore fallen after staying high for a long time.

Other exporters say rice prices are also falling in many other countries, and would dip

further if India resumes exports.

"The economy is going to grow more this year than economists thought just a
couple months ago, according to a new survey.

Forecasters polled in mid-February expected the economy to grow at an annual
rate of 2.2%, a big jump from the 1.3% they projected in December, according to
a survey of 41 professional forecasters by the National Association for Business

Economics. 1!

The forecasters upwardly revised their projections for key parts of the economy
including consumer spending, investment, and hiring by employers based on
recent reports. They also lowered their inflation outlook and mostly assumed
the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate later this year, which
would further spur growth as borrowing costs on all kinds of loans would fall.

"The world is mired in $315 trillion of debt, according to a report from the
Institute of International Finance.

This global debt wave has been the biggest, fastest and most wide-ranging rise
in debt since World War II, coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic.

“This increase marks the second consecutive quarterly rise and was primarily
driven by emerging markets, where debt surged to an unprecedented high of
over $105 trillion—$55 trillion more than a decade ago,” the IIF said in its
quarterly Global Debt Monitor report released in May.

Around two-thirds of the $315 trillion owed originates from mature
‘economies, with Japan and the United States contributing the most to that debt
pile.

However, the debt-to-GDP ratio for mature economies — which is seen asa

good indicator ofa country’s ability to service its debts —has been falling in
general.

(On the other hand, emerging markets held $105 trillion in debt, but their debt-
to-GDP ratio hit a new high of 257%, pushing the overall ratio up for the first

time in three years.
China, India and Mexico were the biggest contributors, the report noted.

The IIF identified stubborn inflation, rising trade friction and geopolitical
tensions as factors that could pose a significant risk to debt dynamics, “putting
upward pressure on global funding costs.”

“While the health of household balance sheets should provide a cushion
against ‘higher for longer rates’ in the near term, government budget deficits
are still higher than pre-pandemic levels,” the IIF added.

Oftthe $315 trillion debt stock, household debt, which includes mortgages,
credit cards and student debt, among others, amounted to $59.1 trillion.

Business debt, which corporations use to finance their operations and
growth, stood at $164.5 trillion, with the financial sector alone making up
$70.4 trillion of that amount. Public debt made up the rest at $91.4 trillion.

"Turkey’s inflation accelerated to 69.8% annually for the month of April, the
Turkish Statistical Institute reported Friday.

The highest consumer price increases year on year were in education, with a
103.86% jump, and hotels, cafes and restaurants, with an increase of 95.82%.

Ona monthly basis, Turkey’s inflation climbed 3.18%, led by price rises in
alcoholic beverages and tobacco, and hotels, cafes and restaurants.

April's inflation rate marks the highest annual increase since November 2022,
when inflation was around 85%.

While an eye-watering figure, April's nearly 70% CPI read was actually
smaller jump than many analysts had expected. But any hopes of interest rate
cuts are along way off, economists said.

Turkey’s central bank has hiked its key interest rate to 50%, citing the
continuing need to counter climbing inflation in the country. The bank said in
March that “tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and
sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed.”

“The slightly smaller-than-expected rise in Turkish inflation in April to 69.8%
y/y (Consensus 70.3%) offers encouraging signs that price pressures have
softened again,” Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at London-
based Capital Economics, wrote in anote Friday.

quite as optimistic on the pace of disinflation. ... Against this backdrop, we still
don't expect the central bank to shift to cuts until next year.”

"Private payrolls increased at a faster-than-expected pace in April, indicating
there are still plenty of tail winds for the U.S. labor market, according to ADP.

A separate report indicated that job openings continue on the decline, falling to

their lowest level since early 2021.

The payrolls processing firm reported Wednesday that companies added
192,000 workers for the month, better than the Dow Jones consensus outlook
for 183,000 though a slight step down from the upwardly revised 208,000 in
March.

At the same time, the firm’s wage measure showed worker pay up 5% froma
year ago, a multiyear low that provided some welcome news against multiple
other signs showing inflation has proved more resilient than many economists
and policymakers had expected.

“Hiring was broad-based in April,” ADP’s chief economist, Nela Richardson,
said. “Only the information sector - telecommunications, media, and
information technology - showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest
pace of pay gains since August 2021.”

Job gains were strongestiin leisure and hospitality, which posted an increase of
56,000. Other industries showing gains included construction (35,000) and
sectors covering trade, transportation and utilities as well as education and

health services, both of which saw increases of 26,000.

Professional and business services contributed 22,000 to the total while
financial activities added 16,000.

Europe’s macroeconomic outlook is brighter — but markets may be
underestimating the potential for sudden destabilization due to geopolitics, the
vice-president of the European Central Bank said Thursday.

“We are talking about the electoral cycle that is going to take place not only in
the U.S., but as well in Europe. And simultaneously, we are referring to
‘geopolitical risks. Ithink that, you know, markets sometimes are
underestimating the potential impact of geopolitical risks that are there,” Luis
de Guindos told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach.

‘Markets are good at calibrating financial and economic risks but struggle to
incorporate the separate dimension of geopolitical risk which is often viewed

asan all-or-nothing binary, he said.

Stock markets in Europe and the U.S. have soared to record highs this year,
brushing past the impact of ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and a
host of coming elections in which half the world’s adult population will head to
the polls.

The ECB on Thursday released its latest Financial Stability Report, which
stated that euro area financial stability has improved due to a better economic
outlook and falling inflation.

Rising geopolitical risks present “considerable downside risks,” the ECB
warned in the report. Risks remain “high” on ahistorical basis, it added, given
factors such as rising debt service costs, signs of banking profits peaking, and

the ongoing downturn in commercial real estate.

The report attributes the rally in financial markets to analyst expectations of
interest rate cuts from major central banks this year.

“Growing signs of pricing-for-perfection [are] creating the potential for

outsized market reactions to disappointments,” the report said.

De Guindos said the ECB did not factor in any concrete outcomes when it
comes to the results of the elections, but that overall they posed the possibility
of additional fragmentation in the global economy.

"The BOE's interest rate decision was followed Friday by the latest U.K. gross

GDP increased by 0.6% compared with the 0.4% estimate, marking the first
quarter since the end of 2021 in with GDP growth exceeded 0.5%.

The economy thereby exited the technical recession it had entered after two

consecutive quarters of contraction in the second half of last year.

“This is undeniably a strong number and suggests the U.K. economy is shaking
off its woes from 2023,” Nomura analysts said in a note published Friday. This
could suggest that inflationary pressures are persistent and the economy is

more resilient to higher interest rates, they noted.

The BOE on Thursday warned that indicators of persistent inflation “remain
elevated,” but also said it was anticipating inflation to close in on the 2% target
in the near term.

“This [GDP] release further strengthens our view that the Bank of England will
need to keep policy restrictive for longer than markets are pricing to bear down
on inflation,” Nomura analysts said, adding they expected the central bank to

wait until August before cutting rates.

"Tighter Credit Standards, High Interest Rates Causing
Downshift

Recently, banks have made it harder to get all kinds of credit, including credit
cards.

Loan officers have gotten increasingly worried about the direction of the
economy and that borrowers won't be able to pay loans back amid high interest
rates and a slowing job market. They've lowered the credit limits offered and
raised the credit scores required to get a new card, and generally made it harder
to qualify to borrow—in economics jargon, they've “tightened” credit.

Higher interest rates may also be playing a role. The Federal Reserve's
campaign of anti-inflation interest rate hikes has driven the average interest
rate for a credit card up to 21.59% as of February, its highest since the Fed
began keeping track of rates in 1994, making credit card balances weigh heavier
on household budgets. |

“Growth in the stock of consumer credit is firmly on a downward trend as
higher interest rates and tighter lending standards crimp borrowing,” Shandor
Whitcher, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a commentary. “These
factors are expected to hold growth to roughly this pace into 2025.""!4]

"Imported Thai fruit prices plummet
on rising supply

8yHong Chau = | 06:19 a

 

Mangosteen, mini durian, snake fruit, and rambutan imported from Thailand are 30-
40% cheaper than a year ago since supply is high.

Loan, who runs a shop that sells imported fruits in HCMC, said Thai fruits have never
been as cheap as they are this year.

Mangosteen and langsat are sold at VND55,000-60,000 (USS2.16-2.36) per
Kilogram, and rambutan at VND45,000-60,000, all 30-40% less than a year ago, she
said.

Lan, a fruit merchant at the city’s Ba Chieu Market, said the prices of premium
products such as Thai snake fruit and mini durian are also down 40%.

Snake fruit sells for VND60,000-70,000 and mini durian for VND60,000-130,000,
she said.

“This year Thai fruits outcompete Vietnamese ones in both quality and price.”

At wholesale markets in HCMC’s Thu Due City and Hoc Mon District, many kinds of
Thai fruits are being sold in large quantities.

Thanh, an importer in An Giang Province, said the supply of Thai fruits has doubled
from last year due to bountiful harvests, causing their prices to fall sharply.

‘The mangosteen, langsat and rambutan from that country are of higher quality this
year, while Vietnamese crops have suffered from a poor harvest, he said.

This year mangosteen production in Binh Duong Province, one of the main growers,
is estimated to have halved from a year ago, according to local farmers.

Durian production in the Mekong Delta has declined by 20-40% due to prolonged dry
weather and scorching temperatures.

Farmers have also been shifting away from rambutan in recent years due to its low
profitability.

This year, shipping costs have decreased by 20-30% from last year, Thanh said. Many
importers have begun to transport fruits from Thailand by road through Cambodia to
lower costs, he added.

In the first four months of 2024 Vietnam imported $643 million worth of fruits and
vegetables, up 15% year-on-year.

Thailand accounted for $13.3 million, marking a 5% increase from the same period

"Vietnam inflation approaches
government limit in May

‘Vietnam's annual inflation rate edged up to 4.449% in May, nearing the government's
target ceiling of 4.5% for the year and a potential challenge to efforts to boost credit
growth to drive activity.

The Southeast Asian country, a regional industrial hub, also reported strong growth in
exports and industrial output in the month, but rising inflation could be a concern for
authorities, official data showed on Wednesday.

Consumer prices had risen 4.4% in April from a year earlier, and rose 3.25% in 2023.

‘Vietnam is targeting economic growth of 6.0%-6.5% this year, faster than an expansion
of 5.05% last year.

The central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, is aiming for credit growth of 15% to help
meet the growth goal, but banks have struggled to increase their lending this year.

Banks’ total outstanding loans as of May 10 had risen 1.95% from the end of last year,
state media cited the central bank as saying on Tuesday.

Oxford Economics said on Wednesday it expected exports to continue to grow solidly,
but the boost to GDP would likely be limited.

 

‘Interest rates in Vietnam's largest importer, the U.S., are likely to stay higher for
longer and the overall global external outlook is soft,” Oxford Economics said.

""We expect 2024 GDP growth to miss the 6.0-6.5% target,” it added.

Other data released by the General Statistics Office (GSO) on Wednesday showed
exports are estimated to have risen 15.8% in May from a year earlier to $32.81 billion,
led by shipments of electronics and smartphones.

Imports in the month are estimated to have grown an annual 29.9% to $33.81 billion,
resulting in a trade deficit of $1 billion for May, the GSO said.

Shipments of smartphones in May are estimated to have risen 50.6% from a year
earlier to $4.4 billion, while electronics exports rose 31.5% to $5.9 billion.

Industrial output in the month rose an annual 8.9% and retail sales were up 9.5%, the
GSO said.

Oxford Economics said it expected the central bank to keep its discount rate
unchanged at 3% for the rest of the year, but added that ""the key risk to the policy rate
lies with the Vietnamese dong, which has depreciated against the U.S. dollar by an
estimated 4.4% year-to-date"".

VinFast is recalling 2,097 electric vehicles to fix various technical issues.

Some of the VF e34 and VF 5 Plus cars produced between September 2023
and April 2024 face the threat of bolts securing the upper cover of the high-
voltage battery becoming loose, leading to a potential reduction in the water

resistance.
This issue affects 23 VF e34 and 131 VF 5 Plus units.

VinFast will inspect and tighten the bolts and replace the high-voltage battery
ifnneeded.

VF 6 Plus vehicles produced between March 18 and April 9 this year have a
potential defect that could cause the brake fluid hose connectors to crack,
leading to possible brake fluid leakage.

If the brake fluid drops below the minimum threshold, a warning will appear
on the control screen, and the braking system's effectiveness will be reduced.
The number of potentially affected vehicles is 47.

VinFast will inspect and replace the brake fluid hoses in the affected vehicles
free of charge.

In VF 8 and VF 9 (Eco and Plus) cars manufactured between August 2022 an
March 2024, incorrect airbag types might have been installed in certain

places.

After approximately 10,000 kilometers of use, an airbag warning and

inspection request may appear on the screen.

If the airbags are not of the correct type, they may not deploy in the event of 2
severe collision under certain conditions.

In all, 1,134 VF 8 Eco and VF 8 Plus vehicles and 762 VF 9 Eco and VF 9 Plus
vehicles are being recalled.

"Central bank fears instability if
banking credit growth cap

By Minh Son May 27, 2024 | 02:15 pm GMT#7

Removing the cap on credit growth could lead to a surge in bad debts,
threatening the safety of the banking system, the State Bank of Vietnam has
said.

But Ha Sy Dong, a lawmaker from the central province of Quang Tri, said in
the National Assembly Saturday that the central bank should use interest
rates to manage credit growth instead of capping it.

The SBV said in a report to the NA that Vietnam’s economy is largely
dependent on banks’ funding.

Before 2011 banks were offering high deposit interest rates to mobilize more
money for lending, and this led to excessive bad debts, it said.

Many banks were at risk of failing, it said.

A cap on credit growth was introduced in 2011 to ensure stability, and it
remains necessary now, it said. ""Removing this cap needs to be a gradual
process, and should be done cautiously depending on the market situation.”

The central bank at the beginning of this year allotted each bank a credit
growth limit depending on its performance, and the entire banking system is
expected to increase credit by 15%.

"Thailand becomes Vietnam's
second largest durian importer

By VNA May 31, 2024 | 04:13 pm GMT#7

Khuong,

Thailand imported $22.5 million worth of Vietnamese durian between
January and April, an 82% year-on-year increase, making it Vietnam's
second-largest durian importer.

Dang Phuc Nguyen, General Secretary of the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable
Association (Vinafruit), explained that Thailand's imports surged due to a
severe drought that reduced its own durian supply.

Despite being a leading exporter, Thailand had to import durians to meet
domestic and tourist demand, Nguyen said.

The extreme weather may reduce Thailand's durian production by 42%, or
around 540,000 tons, the Nation quoted Aat Pisanwanich, an expert on
international economics and adviser to Intelligent Research Consultancy as
saying.

Vinafruit Chairman Nguyen Thanh Binh noted that while China remains the
largest importer of Vietnamese fresh durian, Thailand is Vietnam's top frozen

durian importer due to competitive prices.

Most of the frozen durian imported by Thailand is re-exported to third
countries, mainly China, since Vietnam cannot export frozen durian directly
to China.

In the first four months of this year, China, Vietnam's largest durian importer,
imported $432 million worth of Vietnamese durians, a 168% increase from

the previous year.

In April alone, it spent $204 million on Vietnamese durian, a 6.5-fold
increase from last year, according to the Vietnam Fruits & Vegetables
Association (Vinafruit).

Hong Kong was the third-largest importer, spending $3.6 million on
Vietnamese durian between January and April. The Vietnamese business
community is hoping for an early protocol agreement between Vietnam and
China to streamline exports and benefit both farmers and consumers.

In April, Vietnam earned $217 million from durian exports, up 487% from last
year. The total for the first four months reached $470 million, a 146% year-

on-year increase.

Vietnam's fruit and vegetable exports are flourishing, with an annual 28.1%
increase in value to $2.59 billion recorded in the first five months of this year.

Durian, dragon fruit, jackfruit, and banana remain major currency earners,
said Chairman of the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetables Association Nguyen
Thanh Binh.

He predicted the positive trend will continue, citing abundant domestic

supply and rising demand from both traditional and emerging markets.

However, Director of the Department of Crop Production under the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) Nguyen Nhu Cuong
highlighted a potential challenge.

Unfavorable weather conditions have significantly reduced the preliminary
estimate for lychee production in 2024. The current forecast sits at around

200,000 tonnes, a decrease of nearly half compared to 2023.

The northern province of Bac Giang, a major lychee producer, exemplifies this
challenge. The provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
estimated an output of over 100,000 tonnes from its 29,700 ha of lychee
trees, which is just half of what it achieved in 2023. The province expects
lychee exports to reach around 70,000 tonnes this year, representing 70% of
the total output.

China spent $204 million on Vietnamese durian in April, a 6.5-fold increase from the
same period last year.

In the first four months China bought $432 million worth of Vietnamese durians, up
168% year-on-year, according to the Vietnam Fruits & Vegetables Association
(Vinafruit).

This means it bought 92% of Vietnam’s total durian exports, up 8 percentage points
year-on-year.

Vietnam exported its durian at $4,207 per ton on average in the first four months. Last

month, however, price was 5.6% lower than average.

Vinafruit general secretary Dang Phue Nguyen said that Vietnam durian is now in
season and therefore supply is high.

The cost of transportation to China is currently low while there are less competition
from Thai exporters as drought and heatwave reduced production in their country.

Thai exporters have complained that high temperature in April and May cause the skin
of durian to crack and farmers have to sell the ""overheated"" fruit below market rate.

The ongoing drought may reduce Thailand’s durian production this year by 42%, or
around 540,000 tons, the Nation quoted Aat Pisanwanich, an expert on international
economics and adviser to Intelligent Research Consultancy, as saying.

China has now doubled the number of Vietnamese farms approved for exports, which
increased supply.

Vietnamese exporters say that durian quality is increasing while prices are gradually
falling, making exporting easy.

Some farms, however, still use an pesticides in excess and therefore quality control
needs to improve to make Vietnamese durian surpass that of Thailand, a long-time
exporter to China.

‘Nguyen said earlier that farmers in the southern region have been successful in
applying new techniques in growing durian.

""Durian is a strong advantage for Vietnam in competing for the China market. There
are times when Vietnamese sellers are the only ones with supply”.

Last year China bought $2.1 billion worth of durian from Vietnam, but the figure can
reach as high as $2 billion this vear, he added.

Maximum fines for workplace safety breaches in Singapore will increase from
SGD20,000 (USS$14,500) to SGD50,000 (US$37,120) from Jun 1, the Ministry of
Manpower (MOM) said Monday.

From next month, construction sites with a contract sum of SGD5 million or more
have to install surveillance cameras at high-risk locations.

The increased sum is to act as a ""stronger deterrence” against offenses under the
Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act Subsidiary Legislation that could result in

death, serious injury or serious harm, said the ministry.

Such offenses include failing to provide suitable personal protective equipment and no

warning of hazards that may cause serious harm.

According to the MOM, the increase in maximum fines is a proactive step towards
strengthening ownership and accountability of WSH, particularly among senior
company leadership who are responsible for shaping the safety culture at the

workplace.

Regulations on work safety have been tightened after Singapore saw the workplace
fatality rate fall below 1 per 100,000 workers in 2023, the first time it went under that
mark apart from 2020 when work was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The World Bank has offered Vietnam US$11 billion over the next five years to finance
major infrastructure projects.

Its vice president, Manuela V. Ferro made the offer at a meeting with Prime Minister
Pham Minh Chinh Monday, who said he expected concessional financing.

He suggested lending to large and transformative projects such as Hanoi's metro (Van
Cao - Lang Hoa Lac section), the Ho Chi Minh City - Can Tho railway, clean energy
plants, and the one-million-hectares of high-quality rice initiative.

He assigned a deputy prime minister to directly oversee and control the progress on a

monthly basis.
Ferro agreed that the loans should be directed towards large and high-impact projects.

In recent years the bank has provided around $25 billion to Vietnam for socio-

economic development projects.

"Consumers Could Be Slowing Their Spending Pace

The details of the report supported the idea that consumer spending, the most
important part of the economy, could be running out of steam after a long
period of rapid growth. Spending only increased 0.296 in April after jumping
0.796 in March and actually fell 0.196 after adjusting for inflation. Inflation-
adjusted after-tax income also fell 0.19%, the fourth decline in the last 12
months. 2

“Consumer spending in the first month of the new quarter slowed as real
disposable incomes fell,” Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist for LPL Financial,
wrote in a commentary. “Businesses need to prepare for an environment where
consumers are not splurging like they were last year”

It wasn't just Friday's report that hinted at a downshift in consumer spending,
‘The measure of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was revised
Thursday, showing consumer spending decelerated.

""On the one hand, the slowing GDP and slowing personal consumption are a
sign that the economic expansion is cooling, which could be a concern for
‘companies and stock market investors,"" wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment
officer for Independent Advisor Alliance Thursday. ""But on the other hand,
slowing consumption and economic growth could be just the news we need to
see in order for the rate of inflation to keep coming down and allow the Fed to
reduce interest rates after all.”

"Boeing’s first Starliner flight with astronauts on board was called off in the final
minutes on Saturday, and the backup Sunday launch date was also canceled.

The company was targeting a June 1 launch at 12:25 p.m. ET ofits capsule,
which would have carried astronauts to the International Space Station for the

first time in a final major test of the system.

Leaders from Boeing, NASA and the United Launch Alliance, or ULA, held a
press conference later Saturday afternoon to provide updates on the
malfunction and the status of the next launch attempt.

“The disappointment lasts for about three seconds,” said Mark Nappi, Vice
President and Program Manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program. “And

then you just immediately get busy and do your job.”

Boeing had a backup launch date scheduled for Sunday at 12:03 p.m. EDT. But
Saturday evening, NASA announced the cancellation of that Sunday launch “to
give the team additional time to assess a ground support equipment issue” at
the Florida launch site.

NASA plans to provide further updates on the next steps for the rocket launch.
The following possible launch dates are June 5th or June 6th.

‘An investigation into the cause of the malfunction is underway and crew

members may have to work through the night to troubleshoot the issue.

“The leading suspect would be either a hardware problem or a problem with
the network,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno said at the Saturday press conference,
noting that they will not fully know the source of the issue until the

investigation is complete.

"Private sector job growth expanded in March at its fastest pace since July 2023,
indicating continuing buoyance in the U.S. labor market, payrolls processing
firm ADP reported Wednesday.

Companies added 184,000 workers on the month, an increase from the
upwardly revised February gain of 155,000, which also was the Dow Jones
estimate for March.

In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for
‘workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.196 froma year ago, the same rate
as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those
switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months.

“March was surprising not just for the pay gains, butthe sectors that recorded
them,” said ADP’s chief economist, Nela Richardson. “Inflation has been
cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services.”

Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000.
Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (83,000),
trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services
(27,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000.

Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods
providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more
than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs.

Most ofthe growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers,
with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total. Froma regional
standpoint, the South saw the biggest gains, adding 91,000 workers.

The ADP estimate serves as a precursor to the Labor Department's nonfarm
payrolls survey, set to be released Friday, though the numbers often diverge
sharply. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported job growth of
275,000 in February, or 120,000 more than even ADP’s revised figure.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the March count to show growth of
200,000.

 

Solid payroll growth along with improving inflation has allowed the Federal
Reserve to be patient in its approach to easing monetary policy. Central bank
officials expect to start cutting interest rates later this year but have said in
recent days that they haven't seen enough evidence yet that inflation is ona
sustained path lower to begin reductions.

"Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco reported a 25% decline in profit to
$121.3 billion in 2023, down from $161.1 billion in 2022, and boosted its

mega dividend payout despite “economic headwinds.”

Aramco raised its base dividend for the fourth quarter by 4% to $20.3 billion
dollars, and lifted its performance linked dividend by 9% to $10.8 billion,
resulting in a $31 billion dollar payday for the Saudi government and Aramco
stakeholders.

Despite the earnings decline, the result still represents Aramco’s second-
highest net income on record, far outpacing the profitability ofits largest global

 

peers.

“The year-on-year decrease can be attributed to lower crude oil prices and
volumes sold, as well as reduced refining and chemicals margins, partially
offset by a decrease in production royalties during the year and lower income
taxes and zakat,” Aramco said in a statement.

Aramco said total revenue also fell 17% to $440.88 billion, down from
$535.19 billion last year. Free cash flow also fell to $101.2 billion in 2023,
compared to $148.5 billion in 2022.

“Itwas a year that saw global oil demand reach record levels despite
geopolitical volatility, economic headwinds, and inflationary pressures,”
Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told the earnings call on Sunday.

“We expect the global oil market to remain healthy over the remainder of this
year, and we expect it to be fairly robust with growth of about 1.5 million
barrels,” Nasser added. Saudi Arabia led OPEC+ countries last week ina

decision to extend voluntary oil output cuts until the end of June.

Thailand's car manufacturing target for 2024 may be downgraded as production
continues to decline, with a sluggish economy affecting car sales, according to the
Federation of Thai Industries (FTD.

Earlier this year, the federation set the production target of 1.9 million cars, a year~
on-year rise of 3.15%, of which 1.15 million will be for export and 750,000 for
domestic sales.

Last month, total car manufacturing decreased by 11% to 104,667 units, especially in
the pickup segment, which plunged 45.98%, while the passenger car segment fell by
5%.

Surapong Paisitpatanapong, vice-chairman of the FTI and spokesman for its
Automotive Industry Club attributed the fall to a weak economy and banks’
tightening of car loan criteria to avoid non-performing loans.

During January-April, car production dove by 17% year-on-year to 518,790 units, and
auto sales and exports fell by 23.9% and 3.6% year-on-year to 210,494 units and

Some former employees of e-commerce giant Lazada who were laid off in
January will receive extra in payout after the company negotiated with
Singaporean labor unions.

A number of employees will receive an additional two weeks' pay for each year
of service, to be disbursed in approximately two weeks, according to several
former employees who spoke to The Straits Times on the condition of

anonymity.

Others will receive only ""training support"" of $$1,200 (US$888.76), which
will be paid out in August.

The former employees were from Lazada Singapore and Lazada Southeast
Asia. Initially Lazada offered them only two weeks’ pay per year of service,

which was below industry norms.

The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union has negotiated with Lazada for

the additional benefits for the employees who are its members.

National Trades Union Congress secretary-general Ng Chee Meng said in a
Facebook post on May 21 that the union was closing matters with affected

eligible union members.

Lazada in January laid off an undisclosed number of employees in Singapore

and Southeast Asia.

CNBC reported at the time that all functions including commercial, retail and
marketing would be affected by the layoffs.

Various departments within the company and included its regional offices in
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam were affected by the termination.

"Taylor Swift boosts Singapore GDP

By Minh Long. Way 24, 2024

 

Singapore's economy grew 2.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, the
quickest pace in 18 months, partly due to an improvement in tourism sector driven by
American pop star Taylor Switt’s concerts.

The growth matched a preliminary estimate released last month and was stronger
than the 2.5% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. It was the fastest pace since

the economy grew 4.3% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2022.

The trade ministry, which maintained its GDP growth forecast for 2024 at 1.0% to
3.0, said the manufacturing and trade-related sectors were expected to see a gradual

pick-up over the course of the year, according to Reuters.

""The stronger-than-anticipated recovery in air travel and tourism demand will
continue to bolster the growth of aviation- and tourism-related sectors, as well as
consumer-facing sectors,"" Gabriel Lim, the permanent secretary at the Trade
Ministry, said during an online briefing on May 23. ""The payments segment of the
finance and insurance sector will also benefit from higher tourist spending.”

The country weleomed 4.35 million visitors in the first three months, an increase of,
about 50% from the previous year, according to Nikkei Asia, quoting the Singapore

Tourism Board.

Visitors flocked to Singapore in March to catch Swift's series of performances, her

only Southeast Asian stop on a global tour.

Swift sold out all available seats, selling more than 300,000 tickets for the concerts as.
part of her Eras Tour, which includes over 150 concerts on five continents between

March 2023 and December 2024, EFE reported on May 23.

Vietnam exported 499,000 tons of rubber for $743 million in the first 4 months of
this year, up 6.4% in volume and 14% in value, according to the Vietnam Rubber
Association.

China remained the largest consumer of Vietnamese rubber, accounting for 80% of,

the country's total export volume, followed by India.

The association said that with the recovery of the global automobile and tyre
industries, especially in China, Vietmam’s rubber exports will likely enjoy favorable

conditions and are expected to surge in the second quarter.

The association's general secretary Vo Hoang An said there remained room for
Vietnam to increase its exports of rubber materials, as the country can produce 1.3
million tons of rubber latex annually but the local rubber processing sector only

needs over 300,000 tons.

Under a strategy to develop plant cultivation through 2030, rubber yield will be

raised to 1.8-2 tons per hectare.

Last year, Vietnam exported 2.14 million tons of rubber, earning $2.89 billion,
according to figures from the General Department of Customs. The figures
represented a year-on-year increase of 0.04% in volume but a decline of 12.7% in

Egg-shaped lychees from northern Hung Yen Province are being sold at VND240,000

They are up 19% in Hanoi at VNDig0,000.

A similar variety grown in Hai Duong Province costs VND160,000-170,000.

Hong, the owner of a fruit store in HCMC, said the lychee is much sought-after and
sells out quickly despite the high prices.

“Lam selling egg-shaped lychees from Hung Yen’s Phu Cu District. They have to be
transported by air to retain their freshness and fragrance.”

Hoa, who runs a food store in Hanoi, said this variety of lychee is always in demand

since it is harvested for only one month starting in May.

They are more expensive than regular or seedless lychees due to their size, which is as
large as a chicken egg, and thicker, more fragrant and sweeter pulp.

A kilogram of egg-shaped lychee usually consists of 19-20 fruits, while regular
varieties number 28-30.

""My shop has sold 300-400 kilograms of lychees in the last three days,"" Hoa said.

Farmers and merchants expect the fruit to sell out quickly this year because its supply

is down from last year.

Dong Thi Thu Huong, director of the Minh Tien Agricultural Cooperative in Hung
‘Yen, said the cooperative's 20 hectares of egg lychees would be ready for harvest in
five to ten days.

‘Some 70% of the crop has already been bought at VND145,000-150,000 per

kilogram, she said.
""The harvest is down by 50% from last year, so the price is higher.”

Regular varieties are sold at VND35,000-45,000 per kilogram at the farm gate, she
added.

The leaders of the Phu Cu District People's Committee said of the 1,200 ha under
Iychees, 350 ha grow the egg-shaped variety.

The fruits meet all quality standards and are marked with traceability labels, they

"Drought reduces durian yields and
quality

Durian farmers in Vietnam are worried that saltwater intrusion and drought at the
country’s main hub of durian production will reduce the spiky fruit's yield and lower
its quality.

""The key problem of this durian harvest season is the prolonged drought and sea
water intrusion that decreased the yield and quality of Vietnam’s durian farms,"" Vo
Huu Thoai, director of the country’s Southern Fruit Institute, told CNA.

‘The Mekong Delta, which produces hal of the country’s durian, has been severely
affected by shifting weather patterns and increasing saltwater intrusion in recent
years, Hydropower dams built upstream on the Mekong River restrict the
downstream flow, leading to a freshwater shortage.

‘Thousands of people in the delta are suffering a ""severe"" shortage of fresh water
‘because of drought and salinization, prompting authorities to declare a state of,
emergency early last month, according to AFP.

‘The drought, combined with the heat wave sweeping across Southeast Asia and the El
‘Nino phenomenon, has worsened saltwater intrusion this year, impacting durian
production.

""The biggest threat to durians is saltwater. Durian trees are highly susceptible to salt
water,” durian farmer Tran Van Nghia told CNA. Nghia was among the first to import
Monthong durian trees from Thailand more than two decades ago to grow in
southern Tien Giang provinee, located along the banks of the Mekong River.

Phan Hoang Tan, who owns a durian orchard in the Mekong Delta province of Ben
‘Tre, said his farm's production has dropped by 30% from the previous three harvests
due to scorching temperatures and a lack of freshwater, Vietnamese newspaper
Thanh Nien reported.

Several orchards in Dong Nai Province have also warmed that the next harvest's,
output might slide 30-40%.

‘Thoai said: ""The problem is set to get worse in the coming years if we don’t act fast
enough to implement the solutions.”

‘Vietnam exported $2.3 billion worth of durian last year, 87% of it to China.

‘This figure is forecast to soar to $3.5 billion this year amid burgeoning demand from
‘that country, but this growth may become uncertain due to the drought and saltwater
intrusion.

  

In contrast to Vietnam, the heat wave in the region is expected to enhance Malays’
durian production, especially for its Musang King variety.

‘This could increase competition for Vietnam as Malaysia is finalizing talks to export
fresh durians to China by the end of 2024, The Business Times reported.

Aside from that, oversupply may become a concer in the coming years as
‘Vietnamese farmers switch from other crops to durians.

‘The country now has 150,000 hectares under durian across, exceeding the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development's target of 75,000 hectares.

‘Nonetheless, only about 13% of Vietnam’s durian farms have met the requirements
and been approved for export to China.

Malaysia's main durian harvest season is delayed by unpredictable weather, raising
concerns among exporters about the reduced quality and quantity of the fruit,
potentially affecting exports to China,

‘The harvest season usually runs from May to August, but in Johor, the fruits are not
ready for harvest yet, durian merchant Tie Kian Chow told CNA.

He suggested that recent fluctuations in weather pattems are causing the delay. ""The
‘weather alternates between very hot and rainy, this makes it hard for the durians to
‘ear fruit, especially those of premium quality like Mao Shao Wang (Musang King).""

Johor, which has 20,075,6 hectares under durian, is Malaysia’s main producer of the
fruit, acoording to Malaysia-based news website The Star.

Tie also expressed concer that the fruit’s quality might be affected and fall below the
stringent standards set by China, the world’s largest durian consumer.

Malaysia has been reeling from scorching weather, extreme rainfall and flash floods
in recent weeks, attributed to the heatwave in Southeast Asia and the El Nino
phenomenon.

Such weather patterns could directly impact yields, durian consultant Lim Chin Kee,
‘who owns plantations in Raub, Pahang, told CNA. ""It's possible that the yield will be
much lower this year because the weather is out of syne (with the usual pattern).”

‘Tommy Chong, a durian researcher and farmer in Kulai, Johor, warned that the
extreme weather could lead to more ""burnt tip"" durians, which are unacceptable to
Chinese importers.

Burnt tips refer to the ends of durian pulp tuning brown or dark brown due to
uneven ripening.

This could tarnish Malaysia’s reputation for supplying top-quality durians, which is
particularly concerning as the country is close to concluding negotiations to export
fresh durians to China by the end of the year, The Business Times reported.

Ti successful, Malaysia, which currently only exports frozen durian to China, will
begin competing with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines for a larger share of
China's lucrative fresh durian market.

‘Teoh Sock Soon, owner of retailer Ah Shui Durian in Johor, said lower output could
drive up prices, impacting the competitiveness of Malaysian durian in the Chinese
market.

‘These could jeopardize Malaysia’s plans to double durian exports from RMis8.83
billion (US$25.36 billion) in 2023 to RM238.4 billion this year, according to the Sun.

Competing with other countries who have a greater market share in China means
Malaysia must be able to adapt to Chinese consumers’ changing preferences.

Lim said: ""From our surveys, the new flavor that the China markets is favoring is
Black Thorn, which has a sweeter taste compared to Musang King which is slightly
bitter.”

To cater to this, Malaysian exporters have shifted their focus to cultivating more
Black Thorn trees, which typically take five to 10 years to yield fruits.

Black Thorn only accounts for 1% of Malaysia's total durian production now and
Musang King for 36%, according to its agricultural ministry.

"Red Lobster seeks bankruptcy
protection with $100M in financing
commitments

U.S--based restaurant chain Red Lobster has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in a Florida court after securing $100 million in financing commitments
from its existing lenders, the company said on Sunday.

The company listed its assets and liabilities to be between $1 billion and $10 billion,
according to a court filing.

Red Lobster said its restaurants will be open and operate as usual during the
bankruptey proceedings, and plans to reduce its locations as well as pursue sale of
substantially all its assets.

‘The restaurant chain also said ithas entered into a “stalking horse"" purchase
agreement to sell its business to an entity formed and controlled by its existing term
lenders.

“This restructuring is the best path forward for Red Lobster. It allows us to address
several financial and operational challenges and emerge stronger and re-focused on
our growth,"" said Jonathan Tibus, CEO of Red Lobster.

Red Lobster has about 700 locations around the world, according to its website.

"Red Lobster bas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptry protection days after
shuttering dozens of restaurants.

The US seafood restaurant chain has been struggling for some time with
lease and labor costs piling up in recent years and also promotions such asits
signature all-you-can-eat shrimp deal.

Customer demand overwhelmed what the chain could afford, which also
reportedly contributed to the millions in losses.

Red Lobster said ina court filing that it had more than 100,000 creditors and,
estimated assets between $ibn and $10bn. The company’s estimated
liabilities are between $1bn and $10bn..

The document is signed by the CEO, Jonathan Tibus, a corporate
restructuring specialist who took the top post at Red Lobster in March.

Last week Restaurant liquidator TAGeX Brands announced that it would be
auctioning off the equipment of over 50 Red Lobster locations that were
recently closed as part of the seafood chain’s “footprint rationalization”.

The locations span more than 20 states - cutting back on Red Lobster's
presence in cities like Denver, San Antonio, Indianapolis and Sacramento,
California,

The Orlando, Florida-based chain was founded by Bill Darden, who wanted
to make seafood restaurants more accessible and affordable for families.
Darden sold Red Lobster to General Mills in 1970. General Mills later went on
to form Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and other chains, and
spun the company off in 1995.

In recent years, Red Lobster has been struggling with increasing competition
from fast casual chains such as Chipotle as well as rising lease and labor
costs. Its all-you-can-eat deals for shrimp and lobster also became
increasingly expensive.

"UK company growth is slowing,
Newsflash: Growth across the UK private sector is slowing this month, in
what appears to be a blow to the government's election strategy.

Data firm S&P Global Insight’s regular poll of purchasing managers at British

firms has found that the services sector is recording its weakest growth in six
months during May.

More encouragingly, though, manufacturing has returned to growth - and
firms are raising prices at the slowest rate in over three years.
Here’s the details:
Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 52.8 (down from April’s 54.1), to
2-month low.

Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 52.9 (down from April’s
55.0), toa 6-month low.

Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index at 52.7 (up from April’s 49.4), toa
25-month high.

Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 51.3 (up from April’s 49.1), to a 22-month
high.

Any reading over 50-points shows growth, so Rishi Sunak can at least point
to that, But a slowdown in growth doesn’t bolster the PM’s claim the
economy has “turned the corner”.

"Thousands of UK companies have exploited their corporate power to
increase profit margins since the pandemic, redistributing wealth from
employees to employers and shareholders, according to the biggest study yet
of data since 2019.

 

A trawl through the accounts of 17,000 companies by the trade union Unite
found pre-tax profit margins were 30% higher on average in 2022 compared
with the average across 2018 and 2019. Post-tax margins were on average
20% higher.

The findings are likely to further fuel concerns over widespread profiteering
during the inflation crisis - triggered by the reopening of economies after
pandemic lockdowns and war in Ukraine - with some businesses using the
rising cost of living as an opportunity to increase their margins.

Companies of all sizes and from almost all sectors, from banks to shipping
firms and veterinary practices, saw pre-tax profit margins rise, even as wages
have fallen in real terms and investment has slumped, the analysis shows.

“This is why our economy is broken,’ said the Unite general secretary,
Sharon Graham. “Because of the choices of executives, investors, and
politicians who choose short-term profits and fat dividends over investing in
our industries and public goods.”

Electricity generation companies and big banks have benefited most, the
study found. Of the 16,600 companies analysed, 9,651 were shown to have
increased their profit margins over the period, or roughly 60%.

However, post-tax profit margins in these sectors were tempered by
government windfall taxes, introduced to return some of the gains to the
taxpayer. The Energy Price Levy increased the windfall tax on energy and gas
companies from 25% to 35% in January 2023, while the rise in corporation tax
combined with the Bank Levy increased tax on banks from 27% to 28%.

The data also includes overseas profits made by UK registered companies,
which would not have been inflationary in the UK.

"Ukraine’s war-torn economy faces a renewed threat as Russia’s intensifying
war takes its toll on power plants and forces Kyiv to send key workers to the
frontline, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
warned.

Inits latest economic update, the EBRD cut its growth forecasts and said
more than two years of fighting in Ukraine was affecting not only the warring,
countries but also their neighbours.

Beata Javorcik, the EBRD’s chief economist, said the war was “casting along
shadow” as she announced the bank had cut its growth forecast for the
regions in which it operates from 3.2% to 39 this year.

The EBRD was set up to help rebuild the economies of the former Soviet
Union and eastern Europe after communism collapsed in the early 1990s, but
subsequently expanded to offer support to countries in the Balkans, the
Middle East and north Africa

Interviewed by the Guardian after Russia's offensive towards Ukraine’s
second city, Kharkiv, Javorcik said: “The war has intensified. Mobilising
additional men to fight will hit the economy, and the destruction of power
generation is something that will have repercussions. The situation is
challenging”

Heavy bombing in March and April had cut Ukraine's electricity production
by 40%, with many thermal and hydro plants destroyed, she sai.

Ukraine's economy contracted by almost a third in 2022 before rebounding
modestly in 2023. The EBRD is expecting it to grow by 3% this year. Javorcik
said the good news for Kyiv was that $6ibn of US financial aid had covered

the gap between government spending and revenue this year and that the

Black Sea corridor was open for its exports.

“The authorities have managed to keep the macro economy stable and that’s
abigachievement.

“The war is the big unknown. Inthe intial phase of the war the military
fighting took place in an area that generated 60% of Ukraine’s economic
activity. Subsequently, the fighting moved toa much smaller area. Ifthe area
affected by the fighting goes back to the early days of the war that would take
its toll ofthe economy.”

The EBRD has revised up its 2024 growth forecast for Russia this year from
1%6t02.5% but Javorcik said the exodus of foreign firms and skilled workers
would eventually be felt.

“While the short-term outlook for Russia has improved, in the medium term
Russia is going to feel the effects ofthe war. Sanctions and the impact of the
brain drain will affect its productivity growth.”

"BoE's Pill: Not unreasonable that we could consider rate cuts
this summer

The Bank of England’s chief economist has said it is “not unreasonable” to
think the central bank could consider cutting interest rates over the
summer, Reuters reports.

This has knocked the pound, which is down almost half a cent this morning
at $1.252.

Huw Pill told an online presentation organised by accountancy body ICAEW
that if inflation continues to look less persistent, the Bank could consider
lowering Bank Rate.

He says:

44 “I think it’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will
begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that Bank Rate will
come into consideration.”

Pill also explained that the UK’s labour market remains tight by historical
standards, despite this morning’s rise in unemployment and the gradual
slowdown in pay growth.

He said:

44 “There has been an easing of the labour market but it still remains pretty
tight by historical standards.”

Pill also pointed to the slowdown in private sector pay growth in this
morning’s data (to 5.9%, see here), saying:

44 “We actually got some additional data this morning that would be
consistent with a small additional decline in the first quarter”

"The TUC boss, Paul Nowak, could be accused of exaggeration when he says
“the Tories are presiding over a rapidly deteriorating jobs market”.

The UK has experienced many periods when unemployment has
deteriorated more quickly and the number of people out of work reached
greater peaks.

The union leader is concerned after the latest labour market figures showed
unemployment rising by 166,000 over the last quarter to 1,486,000 to reach
4.3% of the workforce.

 

Emphasising the noticeable deterioration in the jobs market, the number of
vacancies fell and the amount of workers in employment also dropped,
indicating that firms are neither looking for as many workers as they were
previously, nor are they prepared to hang on to as many as they once did.

Joe Nellis, the professor of global economy at the Cranfield School of
Management, expects the rise in the unemployment rate to continue towards
the end of the year, peaking at about 5%.

Yet, the numbers are not huge ina historical context and the economy is
growing, as we found out last week when the Office for National Statistics
produced figures for national output, or gross domestic product (GDP),
covering the first quarter.

The 0.6% rise in GDP between January and March this year marked a
turnaround from last year’s recession and indicated businesses were more
optimistic about the year ahead.

Pay growth is also consistently strong, allowing Jeremy Hunt to boast that
wages have risen faster than inflation for the past 10 months, easing the cost
of living pressures on households.

Still, Nowak’s analysis not only gathers up the evidence of a slowdown from
the current figures, but also looks ahead to the summer and autumn, when
one of the biggest costs facing businesses and homeowners, namely interest
bills, is likely to remain high.

The Bank of England seems determined to keep interest rates painfully
onerous for those with debts to service, even if't slices a few tenths of a
percentage point off the 5.25% total before the end of the year.

"Spending on the NHS in England has risen less quickly than the
Conservatives promised at the last election despite the extra demand create
by the pandemicand record waiting lists, a leading thinktank has said.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said increases in funding from the
government had been eaten up by higher than expected inflation and, asa
result, NHS day-to-day spending had grown by 2.7% a year during the curren
parliament - below the 3.3% pledged by Boris Johnson in 2019.

The IFS said that “despite a pandemic, record waiting lists and growing rates
ofill health, real-terms health spending has risen less quickly than was
planned five years ago.

“This breaks the habit ofa lifetime: over the past 40 years, the NHIS budget
has almost always grown mote quickly than originally planned. This

At the 2019 election, the Conservatives pledged to increase spending by
ex4bna year by the end of the parliament.

The IFS said this amounted to a 29% cash increase between 2019 and 2020
and 2024-25, which given the expected levels of inflation at the time
amounted toa 3.3% annual increase in real terms day-to-day spending. The
latest plans involve a bigger cash increase of 37% Dut much higher inflation
means a real terms increase of 2.79% year.

Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) rose sharply as
economies emerged from lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, peaking
at 11.1% in October 2022.

Last year, the government and unions thrashed out a two-year NHS pay deal
after strike action.

The thinktank also said the NHS was ina poor state of repair due toa lack of
investment over the past decade and a half.

After being cut back sharply in the 2010s, capital spending has increased in
recent years - though in 2023-24, the capital budget in England was raided t

“One consequence of low capital spending is the deterioration of the NHS
estate in England, where the maintenance backlog has more than doubled
over the past decade,” the IFS said,

Although day-to-day NHS spending has undershot the plans made in 2019,

"Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused the Bank of England of “miserable
incompetence” over its failure to reduce inflation more quickly and its bond-
selling strategy, as rightwing Tories prepare to renew their attacks on the
Bank's independence.

‘The former business secretary accused the Bank of damaging the economy
‘with its interest rate decisions and costing the taxpayer tens of billions of
pounds by selling off government debt too quickly in an attempt to reduce its
balance sheet ~a policy known as quantitative tightening (QT).

His comments came as members of Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite
‘group of Tory MPs, prepared to launch a report that once more called into
‘question the Bank’s independence, echoing criticism levied at the bank by
the former prime minister Liz Truss.

Rees-Mogg said: “Quantitative tightening is not part of the Bank’s
independent monetary strategy. Its a joint policy between it and the
government funded by tax. This year it could cost 46bn because the Bank
bras failed again,

“Its miserable incompetence allowed inflation to peak at almost six times its
target rate and now it is demanding higher taxes because of its hopeless bond
‘trading strategy. It makes Nick Leeson, who bankrupted {the London-based
bank] Barings, look clever.""

‘The Bank of England has been contacted for comment.

Relations between the Bank and the right of the Tory party have been
fractious since Liz Truss's short tenure in Downing Street, during which she
considered sacking its top bosses, she later admitted.

‘Many Conservatives have criticised the Bank for not raising interest rates,
‘more quickly, a decision they said had led to monetary policymakers having
to keep them higher for longer than in other countries. The Bank decided last
‘week to keep the base rate at 5.25%,

‘Truss's allies have since called for decisions on interest rates to be handed
back to ministers, more than 25 years after they were taken out ofthe reach

(On Tuesday members of Conservative Way Forward will call for a review into
the Bank’s independence as part of a report that focuses on the losses made
by the Bank’s quantitative tightening policy.

Like other central banks, the Bank of England began buying up government
debt in the wake of the 2008 crash in an attempt to stimulate the economy. It
is now seeking to undo those purchases, in part to give it more room to
repeat them in the event of another financial criss.

Unlike other central banks, however, the Bank has decided not tolet the
bonds it holds expire naturally, but instead to sell them into the private
‘market more quickly, with any losses incurred being footed by the taxpayer.

select committee, called the policy a “leap in the dark for the British

The plan, first reported by Bloomberg, would be the culmination ofa review

"Bank: We could cut rates faster than City expects:
‘The Bank of England could cut interest rates faster than investors expect,
governor Andrew Bailey declares.

He tells reporters in London that interest rates are likely tobe cut “in the
coming quarters”, to avoid inflation falling sharply below its 2% target.

Bailey says:

 

U4 With the progress we have made, to make sure that inflation stays around
the 2% target, and is neither too high nor too low, its likely that we will need to
cut bank rate over the coming quarters and make monetary policy somewhat
less restrictive over the forecast period.

Possibly more so than currently priced into market rate

Before today’s meeting, investors expected two cuts to UK interest rates this

"Albckof skilled workers in the country is pushing up UK wages. The dearth
of affordable housing has seen landlords put up rent by an average of 9% in a
single year, weighing on inflation. New costs and controls atthe border after
[Brexit are creating headaches for exporting companies.

‘This cocktail of pressures on the UK economy has prompted analysts from
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to
undercut the UK's own national forecasts for growth. By 2025, the Paris-
based thinktank says, UK growth will be below that of any advanced
‘economy in the G7.

‘The OECD has pencilled ina increase in gross domestic product of just 0.4%
in2024,a lower rate than any G7 member apart from Germany. By 2025, the
‘UK slips to the back, with just 1% growth compared with an average of 1.5%
in the eurozone. Up to now, the government could at least rely on Germany
to own the ttle of sick man of Europe, after some updates to the national
statistics showed the UK recovered more quickly from the pandemic and
Brexit than was previously thought.

‘The Treasury is alittle more optimistic. Its April 2024 survey of independent
forecasts showed an average of 0.5% for 2024 and 1.3% for 2025.

‘The OECD verdict will come asa blow to Rishi Sunak and his chancellor,
Jeremy Hunt, who claim the UK economy is improving, even though it
slumped into a technical recession at the end of 2023. Hunt was quick to
blame high interest rates for the OECD's assessment, signposting statistics
from the International Monetary Fund that showed the UK would grow faster
than other advanced economies in the next six years.

Butall G7 countries have grappled with higher interest rates. While
persistent inflation haunts many eurozone economies, making it harder for
central banks to cut the cost of borrowing, other governments have taken a
different approach to stimulating economic growth, particularly when it
‘comes to business investment.

Britain has consistently sat at the bottom of the OECD league tables for
‘business investment. IF UK business investment had matched the average of
France, Germany and the US since 2008, Britain's GDP would be nearly 4%6
higher today, improving wages by about £1,250 a year, analysis from the
Resolution Foundation thinktank shows. The thinktank argues that rising
foreign ownership of companies, alongside the lack of workers’ voices on
boards, means the managers of UK companies are under less pressure to
realise returns on investment when it comes. Giving workers astakein a
business creates greater engagement and personal investment in long-term
profitability.

‘The OECD outlook serves as an opportunity for the next government to offer
‘more than just certainty about the direction of travel. IF Labour is handed a
‘mandate in the general election, it will need to bring toan end the
uncertainty around border costs hitting UK exporters, increase
apprenticeships to address the skills shortage, and change planning rules to
get housebuilding on target. The party has outlined some ideas, but it will
have to offer more detail on the industrial strategy it has promised in order to
stimulate investment. An idea to create “technical excellence colleges” to
address the skills shortage was light on details of what the status would
bring.

to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, as high
interest rates and the lingering effects of last year’s surge in inflation drag on
growth.

Ina downbeat assessment, the Paris-based thinktank also downgraded its
forecast for UK growth this year to 0.4% from a November forecast of 0.7%.

The UK will fall to the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2025, the OECD
predicts, with growth of 1%, just behind Germany at 1.1%. US and Canada are
forecast to be the fastest growing economies the G7 next year, both growing
1.8%.

The OECD said Britain’s growth rate would be dampened by persistent price
rises in the services sector and shortages of skilled staff that will push back
expected cuts in interest rates.

Sales in British shops have bounced back in May, according to retail data that
suggests slowing inflation is encouraging customers to buy more.

Anet balance of +8% of retailers told a Confederation of British Industry
(CBI) survey that sales volumes were up this month compared with the same
period a year earlier - a sharp improvement on the -44% year-on-year figure
for April. The balance is the difference between companies who answered
that the number of items was “up” or “down”.

 

 

May marked the most positive monthly reading for the CBI distributive
trades survey since December 2022.

Alpesh Paleja, the CBI lead economist, said there were signs of a recovery in
retail in the short term. “Falling inflation, and continuing real wage growth
will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail
sector further,” he said.

‘The figures are likely to be seized on by Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives,
with much of the prime minister’s justification for calling a summer election
based around his claim that “the economy is turning a corner”.

May’s better data follows poor sales values in April and March that were
blamed on bad weather and the ongoing cost of living crisis.

‘The amount of goods bought in April also dropped 2.3% month on month,
according to Office for National Statistics data, with furniture, clothing,
sports equipment, and games and toys among the big ticket items customers
elected to do without. The fall was partly blamed on Easter falling earlier
than usual, at the end of March.

Shop prices are also growing more slowly, according to the CBI’s measure of
selling price inflation. Inflation was at its slowest since August 2020 and
below its long-run average, with the expectation of only a slight pickup in
June.

‘This matched earlier data from the British Retail Consortium showing that
store prices grew at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% the
previous month. This was a huge drop from the high of 9% reached in May
2023 and the slowest price growth since November 2021.

‘The data will be welcomed by the Bank of England as further proof that the

"Introduction: European Central Bank firmly on track for June
rate cut

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the
{financial markets and the world economy.

European consumers and businesses can look forward to lower borrowing,
costs, with the European Central Bank looking firmly on track to cut interest
rates next week.

With inflation having fallen close to the ECB's 296 target, several
policymakers are hinting that the bank will be able to lower rates at its
‘meeting next week,

Philip Lane, the ECB's chief economist, declared in a speech in Dublin:

 

U4 At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the
dynamics of underiying inflation and the strength of monetary policy
transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is
converging to our target ina sustained manner, it would be appropriate to
reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.

After the speech, Lane told reporters that “The discussion about arate cut
next week is not a declaration of victory,” according to the Financial Times.

French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau was even more
categorical, declaring a June rate cut “a done deal” unless there isa shock

Villeroy de Galhau, wo like Lane is a member of the ECB's governing
council, told Germany’s Boersen Zeitung newspaper:

 

14 “Barring a surprise, the first rate ut in June i a done deal, but afterwards
we have several degrees of freedom,

Villeroy de Galhau argued that the ECB should keep its options open about
possible future cuts, adding:

 

 

14 “Idon’t say that we should commit already on July, but let us keep our
{freedom on the timing and pace.”

‘Acutin June would make the ECB one of the first major central banks to
lower rates in the current cycle, after the Swiss National Bank which
surprised the markets with arate cut in March,

Currently, the ECB's deposit facility - paid to banks who make overnight
deposits with the Eurosystem ~is a record high of 4%.

Its main refinancing operations, the rate banks pay when they borrow
‘money from the ECB for one week, is 4.5%.

Annual inflation in the euro area was just 2.4% in April 2024, a near three-
year low, down from 7% a year before.

China's home prices will fall at a faster pace this year with worsening slumps in
property investment and sales, a Reuters poll showed, a sombre reminder to
policymakers as they redouble efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.

‘The poll showed new home prices would fall 5.0% in 2004, versus a 0.9% decline
tipped in a previous survey in February. Prices are likely to remain unchanged in
2025, compared with a 0.5% gain forecast in February.

‘The poll was conducted between May so and May 17, and is likely to have only
partially taken into consideration Friday's government announcement of support
measures to stabilise the property market.

Befjing pledged to facilitate up to 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) in funding and to ease
mortgage rules, with local governments set to buy ""some"" apartments, which many
analysts said marked the government's strongest moves yet to turnaround the sector.

However, questions remain about the latest measures, especially over execution and
‘how the government could help clear trillions of housing inventory.

‘Since the property market plunged into crisis in 2021, Chinese authorities introduced
‘waves of policy support measures to shore up demand with litle effect.

‘The poll showed property sales likely shrank 10.0% in 2024, steeper than the 5.0%
slump forecast in the previous survey, while investment was expected to fall 10.0%
from the 6.:% decline tipped in the earlier poll.

""There's stil high possibility for more supportive policies aimed at stimulating sales
in the short run, which will help ease the decline in property sales,"" said Xingping

"Shop price inflation has eased to the lowest level since November 2021 after
retailers cut the price of big purchases such as furniture and TVs as
households keepa tight rein on spending amid cost of living pressuresand
poor weather.

Prices rose at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% in April- the
slowest pace since November 2021 - according to the latest monitor from the
British Retail Consortium (BRO) trade body and the market research firm
NielsenIQ.

The decrease was led by non-food prices, which fell by an annual rate of
0.89% in May, the second consecutive month of deflation, marking the biggest
drop at the shelf-edge since 2021.

Food prices rose by 3.2% compared with 3.49%a month before, led by an
casing of price increases on fresh food despite concerns about production
during the cold wet spring.

Mike Watkins, the head of business insight at NielsenlQ, said: “Aftera
number of months of falling input prices, we are now seeing food inflation
stabilise and retailers continue to pass on price cuts to shoppers.”

After wage rises and tax cuts for many in April, Watkins said consumer
sentiment was improving but “unseasonable weather” had put an additional
dampener on demand so that promotional activity was likely to continue in
an attempt to drive up spending.

Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Shap price inflation
has returned to normal levels, at just 0.6%. This was helped by slowing food
inflation, with fresh food inflation falling to its lowest level since November
2021. Meanwhile, ambient food inflation remained stickier, especially for
sugary products which continued to feel the effects of high global sugar
prices.

“In non-food, retailers cut furniture prices in an attempt to revive subdued
consumer demand for big-ticket items, and football fans have been able to
grab some bargains on TVs and other audio-visual equipment ahead of this
summer's Euros.”

She called on the government to do more to help bring down inflation amid
an increased burden on businesses from business rates and other levies.

“With an election in a matter of weeks, itis vital that parties detail their
support for customers and retailers in their upcoming manifestos,” Dickinson
said.

"Rural areas have trumped towns and cities in house price growth over the
past five years, with a semi in the countryside the top-performing property
type, according to data for Great Britain.

‘The figures, issued by the mortgage lender Nationwide, showed that average
house prices in predominantly rural areas rose by 22% over the period,
compared with 17% in predominantly urban areas.

Urban flats had typically been the weakest performers over the past five
years, it said.

‘The data captures some of the impact of the “race for space” sparked by the
pandemic, which led to a surge in the numbers of people looking to move out
of cities to rural areas, smaller towns or the coast - typically somewhere with
a bigger garden, closer to open spaces, or offering more room for working
from home.

However, research has suggested that some of those movers subsequently
sold up and moved back to the suburbs or city.

Some of the top-performing rural areas include tourist hotspots such as parts
of Devon and the Lake District, which suggests some of the demand may be
being driven by those buying holiday and second homes, said Nationwide.

Andrew Harvey, the building society’s senior economist, said its analysis.
suggested that average house price growth in local authority areas classified
as predominantly rural “has continued to outpace those of other areas”.

Of the 349 local authorities in Great Britain, the majority (61%) are classified
as predominantly urban, and just over a quarter (26%) as predominantly
rural. The researchers found that rural semi-detached homes had seen the
strongest price growth over the five-year period, with average values
increasing by 24%.

 

Rural terraced homes typically increased by 23% over the same period, as did
urban semis, while rural detached properties were close behind at 22%.

Nationwide said flats had seen “considerably weaker” growth, and this
applied particularly in predominantly urban areas, where prices typically
increased by 5%.

"OX interest rates could be cut this sumer, the Bank of Engtand’s outgaing,
deputy governor said on Monday, adding to the expectation that a first
reduction in borrowing costs could come as soon as next month.

Ben Broadbent, the Bank’s deputy governor for monetary policy, said that if
the economy evolves as expected, borrowing costs cauld possibly be lowered
“some time over the summer” in response to a steep fall in inflation.
Broadbent said the main drivers of inflation over the past two years - the
Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war - had faded and the Bank was
watching to check whether the longer-term domestic effects on prices would
also decline before making. first cut in interest rates.

He said the monetary policy committee's (MPC) nine members must assess
how those “second-round effects” in domestic prices and wages change the
course of inflation over the next two years.

Analysts have diverged over the likelihood of a rebound in inflation later in
the year, possibly forcing the Bank to pauseits plans for rate cuts.

The consultancy Capital Economics has forecast that inflation will fall below
the central bank’s2% target when figures for April are published on
Wednesday and tumble to less than 1% before the end of the year.

“This underpins our forecast that the Bank will cut interest rates from 5.25%
now to 3% next year, rather than to 3.75% as investors expect.” the
consultancy said.

Other analysts expect inflation to bounce back above 3% before the end of
the year as persistently high services inflation and wage increases in the
financial and business services industry remain high, feeding into higher
prices.

Broadbent said: “There is a range of views across the committee on this
point. In view of the rarity of events like this over the past, and the
associated uncertainty about the future, that’s entirely understandable.

“Whatever the priors of its individual members the MPC will continue to
learn from the incoming data and, if things continue to evolve with its
forecasts ~ forecasts that suggest policy will have to become les restrictive at
some point - then it’s possible Bank rate could be cut sometime over the

"US inflation slows to 3.4%

Newsflash: Inflation across the US has slowed, bringing some relief to
American families and perhaps reassuring America’s central bankers that
price pressures are easing.

The consumer price index rose by 3.4% in the year to April, down from 3.5%
in March.

That’s in line with Wall Street forecasts.

In April alone, prices rose by 0.3%, a slowdown on March when they
increased by 0.4%.

Rising costs of housing, and fuel, were both key factors behind inflation last
month.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says:

 

1A The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline. Combined,
these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in
the index for all items.

The energy index rose 1.1 percent over the month. The food index was
unchanged in April. The food at home index declined 0.2 percent, while the
food away from home index rose 0.3 percent over the month.

"Inflation across the US eased slightly last month as concerns about the cost of
living loomed over the battle between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the
White House.

The closely watched consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of
3.4% in April, down from an annual pace of 3.5% the previous month.

The White House released a low-key statement after the figures were
released. “Fighting inflation and lowering costs is my top economic priority,”
said Biden. “I know many families are struggling, and that even though
we've made progress we have a lot more to do.”

Policymakers have been surprised by stubborn price growth, which they
hope to bring down to 2%.

The Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates toa two-decade high to tamp
down inflation and had been expected to start cutting them this year. But
price gains have remained higher than the central bank’s target and hopes of
arate cut have faded.

“We did not expect this to be a smooth road,” Jerome Powell, the Federal
Reserve chair, said before the news on Tuesday, “but these [inflation
readings] were higher than I think anybody expected”

The “core” CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in
April, down from 0.4% in the previous three months, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual rate of core CPI was 3.6% in April, its
lowest rate since April 2021.

 

 

 

Rising housing and fuel costs were the two biggest factors behind April’s
price increases. “The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for
gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed over 70% of the monthly
increase in the index for all items,” the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.

Food prices were flat and egg prices dropped sharply - 7.3% - over the month.

  

“While on the surface it is positive to see inflation fall from the previous
month, looking at the trend over the past 12 months provides a different
picture. Inflation has been bouncing around the 3%-4% range for a
considerable period of time now, and this is now arguably singlehandedly
preventing the Federal Reserve from pushing the button on rate cuts” said
Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors.

"The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew
by 0.6% in the first three months of the year.

‘The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the
end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second
half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of
2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast
growth of 0.4% in the first quarter.

‘The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services
sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have
outstripped inflation, easing pressure on consumers.

However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest
rates and last year’s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable
incomes.

The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy
means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The
Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it
may begin cutting them from June.

"House prices in the UK were steady in April after falling in March, as higher
mortgage rates prompt first-time buyers to go for smaller properties,
according to the mortgage lender Halifax.

The price of atypical home rose by less than £200 last month to £288,949, a
0.1% monthly gain, compared with a 0.9% drop in March, which was the firs
decline in six months. On an annual basis, prices rose 1.1% in April, up from
March's rate of 0.4%, largely because there was weaker price growth this,
time last year, Halifax sad.

“The reality is that average house prices have largely plateaued in the early
part of 2024,” said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. “This
reflects a housing market finding its feet in an era of higher interest rates.
While borrowing costs remain more expensive than a few years ago,
homebuyers are gaining confidence from period of relative stability”

She said buyers were adjusting their expectations, and first-time buyers in
Particular were compensating for higher borrowing costs by targeting smalle
properties. This was reflected in property prices for the first few months of
this year, where the value of flats rose most sharply, closing the “growth gap’
on bigger properties that has existed for most of the past four years.

Bryden said activity and demand were improving and mortgage approvals,
reached their highest point in 18 months. However, affordability remained a
problem for first-time buyers and those rolling off fixed-term mortgage deals

Mortgage rates have edged up again in recent weeks, as financial markets
price ina slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. A first
cut in August is now priced in, and another one is expected later in the year.

The average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate is 5.93%, while the
average five-year fixis 5.5%, according to the financial data provider
Moneyfacts. This compares with an average two-year fix of 5.78%%and a five-
year fix of 5.34% two months ago.

Bryden said: “If as is still expected, downward moves in Bank rate come inte
play later this year, fixed mortgage rates should fall. Combined with the
resilience displayed by the housing market over recent months, we now
expect property prices to rise modestly over the course of 2024.""

The property company Savills has reversed its prediction of a fall this year in
UK house prices made in November, saying it now expects the average price
torise by 2.5% in 2024.

Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, said: “We are not surprised to see
house prices up a bit, then down a bit -a pattern which weare finding is
repeated on the ground, reflecting that some sellers are more realistic than.
others.

“The market has lost a little momentum in the last month or so, which has
chimed with recent modest increases in mortgage rates as well as listings.
However, underlying confidence remains fairly strong for now at least,
allowing purchasers the opportunity to perhaps negotiate a little harder
where possible.”

"Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000
jobs and wage growth slowing.

‘The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt
the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates - which have been driven toa20-
year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets
rose on thenews.

Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000
jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast
April's figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up
from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing
strength of the jobs market.

It was the 4oth straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th
consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% - the longest such
streak since 1953.

Gains were broad-based, with healthcare, social assistance, transportation
and warehousing, manufacturing and construction all adding jobs.

‘The growth in the jobs market has continued even as the Fed has maintained
its rates policy. The Fed said this week that inflation remained high and that
it did not plan to cut interest rates until it has “greater confidence” that price
increases are slowing to the goal of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the
slowdown in price increases was taking longer than expected, but that he
expected inflation to “move back down” this year.

‘Wage gains in April - which are also closely watched by the Fed - were also
lower than forecast, increasing 3.9% from a year earlier after rising 4.1% in
March.

“Despite missing expectations, signaling an economic cooldown, the labor
‘market has still maintained a pattern of growth and consumers can be
cautiously optimistic that the Fed will be able to successfully lower inflation
‘while also avoiding a recession,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at
Trustage.

ADP, the US's largest payroll supplier, reported this week that private sector

"Falling demand fails to depress Hanoi
old apartment prices

Prices of old apartments in Hanoi have not decreased though the market has cooled
off and there have been few transactions in recent weeks.

Over the last month Le Cuong, an experienced broker, has only managed to sell two
old apartments in the eastern part of the city, down nearly 70% from early March

when the market was booming.

Then he used to take nearly 10 interested customers to view apartments every week,
and many would buy after a single tour.

‘Now fewer people are calling to ask about listed apartments and even fewer are
interested in viewing them properties after hearing the price, he said.

Last week he only had six apartment tours but failed to sell anything.

The director of an apartment trading floor in Nam Tu Liem District said transactions
had decreased by 60% over the last month.

Real estate listing platform Batdongsan said interest in the apartment segment has,
plummeted from its peak in March.

Nevertheless, prices are not showing any sign of decreasing though they have stopped
increasing since mid-April.
In Nam Tu Liem’s Tay Mo urban area prices rose by 15% since the beginning of the

year before plateauing.

At an apartment block on Chau Van Liem Street in the same district prices
appreciated by 30-33%.

According to Cuong, only a small number of sellers who urgently need to liquidate
their apartments have offered discounts.

‘Most of these discounted units have not issued title deeds and are far from the city
center, he added.

‘Nguyen Van Dinh, president of the Vietnam Association of Realtors, said the segment
has cooled because more people have become aware of the price inflation in the

market and overcome their ""fear of missing out.”

But prices are unlikely to decrease since housing supply is unable to keep up with
demand, he said.

‘Nguyen Quoc Anh, Batdongsan’s deputy CEO, said it is difficult to increase housing
supply at the flick of a switch.

With amendments to the Land Law and Real Estate Trading Law set to take effect
soon and raise the bar for property developers, supply might continue to be
constrained, he said.

Apartments are sought-after because they are relatively stable long-term

investments, he said.

Considering the increases in rents and prices, apartments have returned 12% a year
in the last decade or so he said.

“They outperform other asset classes such as stocks and cash.”

The Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the recovery in
manufacturing, tourism and consumer-facing services will create momentum for
Singapore's economy to grow by 2.1% in 2024, a pickup from 1.1% last year.

 

 

An IMF team led by Masahiro Nozaki projected this city state's headline and core
inflation will moderate to 3% this year, with the latter expected to stabilize at around

2% by 2095.

According to Nozaki, inflation in Singapore tends to persist due to uncertainties in
global energy and food prices as well a rising labor costs. He called on the country to
maintain a tight monetary policy until inflationary pressure eases, and to adjust the
policy in a timely manner to stabilize prices once there are firm signs of disinflation,

 

 

The expert also noted the support program that the Singaporean Government is
providing for vulnerable households and firms is appropriate and will complement
the tight monetary policy stance.

Singapore can address future risks and medium- and long-run spending needs
arising from the rapidly aging population, demand for higher productivity and

‘The Hanoi Railway Company Limited (Hanoi Metro), the operator of the Cat Linh —
Ha Dong urban metro line, said it made a profit of over VNDi3 billion ($510,730) in
2023, nearly six times more than the previous year.

‘This marks the second consecutive year the company has reported a positive profit

after seven years of losses.

‘The company’s latest audited financial statements showed that the company’s
revenue in 2023 reached over VNDsis billion, an increase of nearly 79 compared to
2022. Ticket sales accounted for approximately VND74 billion ($2.9 million), a 12.5%
increase, with the remainder coming from subsidies.

‘The cost of goods sold increased more than revenue, causing the gross profit for 2023
tobe halved to VND7.8 billion. Consequently, the gross profit margin fell to around
15%.

Financial income surged 12.7 times to nearly VND26 6 billion, all of which came from
interest on deposits as the company had over VND685 billion in idle funds in the
bank. Additionally, the company completely cut loan interest expenses, sono
financial costs were recorded during the period.

Overall, the company made a post-tax profit of over VNDss billion, a 570% increase
compared to 2022 and double the planned target.

In 2022, the company had initially reported a profit of nearly VNDo7 billion in its
first financial report. However, the audit firm required the company to include
depreciation costs for 15 specialized maintenance equipment for the Cat Linh~Ha
Dong metro line into production costs. As a result, the profit for 2022 was adjusted to
over VNDs billion.

‘The company also increased its equity capital from over VND3q billion to more than
‘VND2.68 trillion, a 69-fold increase. Conversely, liabilities decreased 8.7 times to
nearly VND347 billion, mainly due to the completion of procedures to receive all
assets of the Cat Linh - Ha Dong metro line.

‘This year, the company aims to transport neatly 11 million passengers and record
‘total revenue of over VND529 billion, an inerease of about 3% compared to 2023. The
company plans to make profit for the third consecutive year, with a target of over
VND13.4 billion.

In addition to continuing to develop and operate the existing urban railway line, the
company targets to establish the organisation and personnel needed to operate the
‘Nhon — Hanoi Station metro line, including trial operations, management plans,
ticket pricing, and subsidy policies for this project.

‘This urban metro line is more than sgkm long and has 12 stations and 3g trains. Each
‘train, whose designed speed is 80 km per hour, has four carriages capable of carrying
over 900 passengers.

Currently, ticket prices range from VND8,000 for a single ride to VND15,000 for the

Unfortunately, the markets were less impressed.

Wednesday’s inflation data sparked a frenzy among traders who pushed back

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite high interest rates and chronic inflation, the U.S. economy grew at
a 2.9% annual rate from July through September, the government said Wednesday in a healthy
upgrade from its initial estimate.

Last quarter's rise in the U.S. gross domestic product — the economy's total output of goods and
services — followed two straight quarters of contraction. That decline in output had raised fears
that the economy might have slipped into a recession in the first half of the year despite a still-
robust job market and steady consumer spending.

Since then, though, most signs have pointed to a resilient if slow-moving economy, led by steady
hiring, plentiful job openings and low unemployment. Wednesday's government report showed
that the restoration of growth in the July-September period was led by solid gains in exports and
consumer spending that was stronger than originally reported.

“Despite higher borrowing costs and prices, household spending — the driver of the economy —
appears to be holding, which is a positive development for the near-term outlook,’ said Rubeela
Farooq, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

It marked the second of three estimates the Commerce Department will provide of economic
expansion in the third quarter. In its initial estimate, the department had estimated that the
economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter.

Economists expect the economy to eke out modest 1% annualized growth from October through
December, according to a survey of forecasters conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. The nation's manufacturing sector is slowing despite an easing of supply chains
that had been backlogged since the economy began rebounding from the pandemic recession
two years ago. And inflation is threatening to weaken the crucial holiday shopping period.
Retailers say inflation-weary shoppers are shopping cautiously, with many holding out for the
most attractive bargains.

"Ireland has landed a €700m (£600m) Brexit bonanza with a steep increase in
tax revenues flowing from customs duties now applicable to imports of
clothing, food and other goods from Great Britain.

Before Brexit, Britain enjoyed customs-free exports to Ireland and the rest of
the EU because it was part of the single market and customs union.

But when Boris Johnson sealed a hard Brexit and quit the single market, it
meant fresh controls, checks and duties would be payable on exports to the
EU.

New data in Ireland shows a 90% jump in customs duty receipts in Ireland
between 2020 and 2021 when Brexit came into force.

‘Taking the pandemic into account and comparing 2019 with the three post-
Brexit years, a significant jump in revenues can be seen.

In 2021, there was a €178m increase or 52% ri: customs revenues
compared with 2019. In the following year, receipts were 80% higher by the
same comparison, amounting to an extra €617m, and in 2023 the Irish
exchequer scooped a 72% increase.

 

‘The report released by the Irish Revenue Commissioners on Friday noted
thata significant amount of customs duty came from imports from China,

“The level of customs duties has effectively doubled in recent years

"Sir Keir Starmer must prioritise setting out Labour’s spending plans as “dark

"Rachel Reeves hopes to raise £22bn from the private sector

Precise details of Labour’s policy plans are hard to come by, but one thing is clear:
“The National Wealth Fund will be a crucial tool in our armoury towards
bringing about growth,” according to shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.

Reeves has vowed to set up a British sovereign wealth fund if Labour wins

 

power, using it to “create good jobs and spread productivity in every part of the
country”.

There is just one rather large problem: where will the money come from?

It is hard not to be drawn to the overawing power and scale of sovereign wealth
funds.

Globally, 175 such funds manage almost $12 trillion (€9.4 trillion). Typically they
are ways for nations to invest oil wealth, ensuring countries stay rich even if the
fossil fuel revenues dry up.

Norway’s fund is the biggest in the world, worth around $1.3 trillion. This war
chest is underpinned by the country’s North Sea industry: Oslo raked in the
equivalent of £72.5bn from oil in 2023.

The sovereign wealth fund has helped keep the country’s public finances
healthy. Aside from the pandemic year of 2020, Norway has steadily run a budget
surplus of between 4pc and 26pc of GDP every year of this century.

"Industrial production in France has shifted at its most dramatic rate since
May, showing a 1.1% jump in December.

 

The data, released on Thursday, looks at output in a number of areas, including the gas,
electricity, goods, and mining sectors.

December's results were particularly upbeat, with production rising by 1.1% on the month,
following a marginal increase of 0.5% from October to November.

‘Compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, industrial production also jumped by 11% in
the last three months of the year.

Despite this, France's national statistics agency (INSEE), has warned that seasonal
adjustments may have inflated the figures.

INSEE boosts end-of-year results to compensate for workers taking holidays in
December but, the agency pointed out for this year, a high proportion of vacations were
planned in January.

Due to the shift in holidays, this month's numbers may be unnaturally high.

INSEE also highlighted significant variations across the output of different sectors.

“The manufacture of transport equipment has been sustained by a rebound effect
({although] activity in the sector remains well bellow its pre-crisis level), while the
manufacture of food products has been penalised by the sharp decline of food
consumption,"" the agency told Euronews Business.

Output in some energy-intensive industries remained lower in the last quarter of 2023,
‘compared with the second quarter of 2021, as high electricity and gas prices hindered
production.

‘The industry data arrives at the end of a week filled with economic announcements.

of 0.9%. On Wednesday, the country reported easing inflation numbers.

"‘Strong spending in the services sector has seen the UK return to growth.

The UK's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.2% in the month to January, according
to data released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday.

The GDP indicator, which measures the nation’s output, offers a glimpse of hope after the
UK fell into a shallow recession last year, marked by two consecutive quarters of
economic contraction.

“While the [overall growth] figure is tiny, the fact it is growing at all is a positive,” said Russ
Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

“Investors want the UK's recession status cast into the rear-view mirror so they can focus
‘on how potential looser monetary policy could provide relief to consumers and
businesses, and in turn feed into greater economic activity.”

 

Analysts would consider the recession to be over if the economy expands in the first
three months of the year, meaning that the UK is not out of the woods just yet - but the
recent data is a start.

This month's rise was primarily driven by activity in the services sector, as shoppers
splashed the cash in supermarkets and on the High Street.

Services output grew by 0.2% in January, while output in the construction industry was
also up by 11%.

In December, both of these sectors shrunk by 0.1% and 0.5% respectively.

Lagging behind other industries was the production sector, which recorded a contraction
of 0.2% in January, after expanding by 0.6% in December.

The modest overall rise in the growth figure will come as a relief to the governing
Conservative Party ahead of an expected election this year, although the economy
remains in a fragile state.

 

‘Compared with the same month last year, overall GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.3%

"February's expansion in national output raises hopes that the UK is moving
out of a recession.

The UK's gross domestic product rose by 0.1% in February, confirming that the UK
economy has now been expanding for two consecutive months.

January's growth reading, formerly 0.2%, was also revised up to 0.3%, according to data
released by the Office for National Statistics on Friday.

The expansion seen in February, which was in line with analysts’ forecasts, comes as a
welcome sign after the UK slipped into a recession late last year, marked by two
consecutive quarters of economic contraction.

If the economy expands in the first three months of 2024, the recession can be classed
as over, meaning the UK is edging closer towards this goal.

“The continued easing in inflation, particularly following the upcoming drop in household

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate from July through
September, snapping two straight quarters of contraction and overcoming high inflation and
interest rates just as voting begins in midterm elections in which the economy's health has
emerged as a paramount issue.

Thursday's better-than-expected estimate from the Commerce Department showed that the
nation's gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — grew in the third
quarter after having shrunk in the first half of 2022. Stronger exports and consumer spending,
backed by a healthy job market, helped restore growth to the world’s biggest economy at a time
when worries about a possible recession are rising.

Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 1.4%
annual pace in the July-September quarter, down from a 2% rate from April through June. Last
quarter's growth got a major boost from exports, which shot up at an annual pace of 14.4%.
Government spending also helped: It rose at a 2.4% annual pace, the first such increase since
early last year, with sharply higher defense spending leading the way.

Housing investment, though, plunged at a 26% annual pace, hammered by surging mortgage
rates as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises borrowing costs to combat chronic inflation. It
was the sixth straight quarterly drop in residential investment.

"BERLIN (AP) — The German economy grew in the third quarter, an unexpectedly positive
performance powered largely by private spending, official figures showed Friday. But the
immediate outlook for Europe's biggest economy remained gloomy, with inflation rising again in
October.

Gross domestic product expanded by 0.3% in the July-September period compared with the
previous quarter, the Federal Statistical Office said. That followed a slight increase of 0.1% in the
second quarter.

“The German economy managed to hold its ground despite difficult framework conditions of the
global economy, with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain interruptions, rising prices
and the war in Ukraine,” the statistics office said.

The government said earlier this month that GDP was believed to have shrunk in the third quarter
and was expected to decline again in the last three months of the year as well as the first three
months of 2023 before beginning to recover. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is one
technical definition of recession.

With energy prices high, Germany — like many other countries — is grappling with skyrocketing
inflation. The annual inflation rate rose once again in October, climbing to 10.4% from 10% the
previous month, according to a preliminary estimate released by the statistics office on Friday.

On Tuesday, a survey showed German business confidence stuck at its lowest level in more than
two years as energy worries fuel expectations of a difficult winter.

Lawmakers last week cleared the way for the government to provide up to 200 billion euros ($195,
billion) in subsidies to households and businesses through 2024 to ease the strain of high energy
prices, and parliament's upper house added its approval on Friday. However, details of that plan
haven't yet been finalized.

"Rishi Sunak’s tourist tax has left Gatwick at a “competitive disadvantage” to its rivals
abroad, the airport’s chief executive has said.

Stewart Wingate, who has been at the helm of Britain’s second-largest airport since
2009, said the removal of tax-free shopping has hampered Gatwick’s ability to attract
wealthy passengers and long-haul airlines from overseas.

 

He told The Telegraph that the tourism tax is holding back the hub’s push for growth,
particularly as Gatwick vies to compete against European competitors including
Madrid, Milan and Paris.

Mr Wingate is the latest senior business leader to weigh into the debate around the
Government's abolition of tax-free shopping for tourists in 2020, which made goods
20pc cheaper.

“Our position is that we, alongside London and the South East, are at a competitive
disadvantage because when the passengers think where should I go and which city
should I choose, part of the decision-making is whether they can shop tax-free,” he
said.

“Some of these passengers want to buy significant amounts of goods. But if you want
to come to the heart of London and shop for luxury goods, then perhaps you are
going to think twice.”

"he Tory party has tried and failed to convince the public that they are

better off these past few years. This should surprise no one. The spike in

the tax burden, combined with the inflation crisis, has been felt by
practically everyone.

But unlike in America, no one can claim people are experiencing a “vibe-session”,
where the data tells a much better story than the one people sense intuitively. In
Britain, the numbers consistently back up the frustration.

A damning report out from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) this week sums it
up: the “past 15 years” have resulted in the “worst for income growth in
generations” as old and young, rich and poor, have all taken a hit to their
disposable income.

The study reveals that your average Briton would be thousands of pounds better
off had living standards risen at the same rate recorded in the 50 years leading up
to this stretch of Conservative governments.

Adjusted for inflation, the average single person with no children would have
roughly £5,000 more disposable income today - had salaries continued to rise in

"Between January and March, there were 4.3 million 16 to 64-year-olds living in
households where no adult was employed. This is almost 300,000 higher than
the end of last year and the highest total in seven years.

It comes amid a wider worklessness crisis that experts warn is crippling Britain’s
growth as Rishi Sunak gears up for a general election in July.

Nationally, there were 9.4 million working-age adults who were economically
inactive at the beginning of the year, meaning they were neither employed nor
looking for work, up by 832,000 compared with pre-pandemic levels.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP and former business secretary, said high levels
of economic inactivity were a “huge problem” for the country.

He said: “If you have people who are not in work, they’re not going to be helping
to boost GDP per capita. So it means the state has less money to pay either for tax
cuts or public services.

“Tt also encourages people to make the argument that we need mass migration
because there is work that needs to be done and the people who work for us
aren't obviously doing it.”

Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), said the
surge in jobless households was likely driven by an increase in worklessness
among young people.

"Senior Whitehall officials fear Thames Water's financial collapse could trigger
arise in government borrowing costs not seen since the chaos ofthe Liz
Truss mini-budget, the Guardian can reveal.

Such is their concern about the impact on wider borrowing costs for the UK,
even beyond utilities and infrastructure, that they believe Thames should be
renationalised before the general election.

Officials in the Treasury and the UK’s Debt Management Office fear that,
unless the UK's biggest water company is renationalised as soon as possible,
“prolonged uncertainty” about its fate could “damage confidence in UK ple
ata sensitive time”, with elections in the UK and the US later this year.

Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed details of government contingency
plans, known as Project Timber, to renationalise Thames via a special
administration, This could lead to the bulk ofits £1sbn of debt being moved
on tothe government’ balance sheet. Thames"" investors have refused to
pump more money into the struggling company amid a standoff with the
water regulator Ofwat

Some lenders to its core operating company could lose up to 40% of their
money under the plans, a move that officials believe marks a careful balance
between managing public outrage at the water company’s many failures and,
the need to sustain investor confidence in the UK.

Those contingency plans also describe a risk of “contagion” from Thames’s
plight that could trigger a loss of confidence that feeds through to wider state
borrowing costs.

In the aftermath of the Truss mini-budget in September 2022, UK borrowing
costs shot up as government debt markets went into freefall. Her chancellor
Kwasi Kwarteng’s promise of £4sbn of unfunded tax cuts, the sacking of the
most senior civil servant at the Treasury and Truss’s refusal to have her sums
checked by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility spooked
investors and sent the value of UK debt instruments, known as gilts,
plummeting.

The pound hit a low against the dollar not seen since 1985, and the whiplash
effect on the bond market damaged some pension funds’ investment
strategies so severely that the Bank of England had to stage an emergency
market intervention to maintain market stability. That crisis added billions of,
pounds to the UK’s cost of borrowing, as investors demanded a higher price
tolend toit. British households experienced big spikes in mortgage costs, as
banks and building societies passed on higher borrowing costs. Many
mortgage offers were pulled overnight.

While Kwarteng’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the tax plans and
stabilised debt markets, the UK's cost of borrowing has crept up again in
recent months amid geopolitical shocks, including the Middle East conflict.

"A serious escalation of tensions in the Middle East would push the price of oil
above $100 (£80) a barrel and reverse the recent downward trend in global
inflation, the World Bank has said.

The Washington-based institution said the recent fallin commodity prices
had been levelling off even before the recent missile strikes by Iran and Israel
~ making interest rate decisions for central banks tougher.

But it added that its forecast that crude prices would average $84 a barrel this
year would prove too optimistic in the event of the crisis worsening,

Fears of full-scale war in the Middle East have already led toa risein oil
prices and dearer fuel costs for motorists. A barrel of Brent crude is trading at
$87, while the average price ofa litre of unleaded petrol in the UK has edged
above £1.50 for the first time since last November.

The World Bank's latest commodity markets report said: “A moderate
conflict-elated supply disruption could raise the average Brent price this
year to $92 a barrel. A more severe disruption could see oil prices surpass
$100 a barrel, raising global inflation in 2024 by nearly one percentage point.”
Between mid-2022 and mid-2023, global commodity prices plummeted by
nearly 40% and were the driving force behind a near-two-percentage-point
drop in global inflation over that period. Since mid-2025, the World Bank said
its index of commodity prices had remained essentially unchanged,

Financial markets have already pared back expectations about the scale and

pace of interest rate cuts this year in response to stickier than expected
inflation.

Indermit Gill, the World Bank chief economist, said: “Global inflation

“That means interest rates could remain higher than currently expected this,

Sounding the alarm over the tising financial cost from pollution, damage to
water systems, sol erosion, and threats from disease, the report by the Green
Finance Institute warned that further breakdown in the UK's natural

degradation is as detrimental or more so than climate change”.

The continued loss of natural habitats in urban and rural areas would
compare unfavourably with the financial crisis of 2008, which took about 5%
off the value of UK GDP, while the Covid pandemic cost the UK 11% of its GDP
in 2020.

The academics used three scenarios to construct the report: domestic risks
from continued UK environment breakdown; international risks ~ including
destruction to nature in countries which are key UK trading partners; anda

"The prospects of a summer cut in UK interest rates have receded after the
Bank of England's chief economist said inflation must be squeezed out of the

After a key survey signalled strong sales across the private sector over the
past month and the London stock market rose toa record high, Huw Pil said
concerns remained that inflation, which is expected to fall belowits 2%

target within a few months, could then rebound as the economy strengthens

Speaking in London, Pill said: “We still havea reasonable way to go before T
am convinced that the persistent momentum in underlying inflation has
stabilised at rates consistent with achievement of the 29 inflation target on a
sustainable basis”

He added: “{t] is necessary to squeeze the persistent component (of
inflation] out ofthe system.

would start cutting interest rates in September. Earlier in the day, investors
were betting on a first cut in August from 5.25%.

His comments came asa closely watched survey of business activity by S&P

The flash UK purchasing managers’ index (PMI, which covers the services
and manufacturing sectors, rose to54 in April, up from 52.8 inthe previous

month. A figure above 50 indicates a period of expansion.

Pill's warning over inflation came soon after the FTSE 100 hit a record high of
8,076 points, driven by hopes that the UK will cut rates sooner than the US,

and relief that the Middle East crisis has not escalated further.

But Pill’s warning that rate cuts could be delayed deflated some of that stock
market exuberance, sending the London market back down to closeat 8,044
points.

Jonathan Haskel, who sits with Pill on the Bank’s nine-strong monetary
policy committee, indicated at a separate event in London on Tuesday that
the recovery under way in the UK could delay the fist interest rate cut by the
central bank.

Taking a tough stance that contrasted with several other bank officials,
Haskel said more weakness in Britain's labour market was needed tobe
confident that inflation would stay at 2%,

“The labour market is central to the inflation aspect,” Haskel said ata
seminar at City University of London's Bayes Business School when asked if
he now thought it possible inflation would hold at 2% rather than rise later,
this year.

He said the number of job vacancies had fallen while unemployment had
increased, showing that the labour market was weakening, but it was unclea
if it was weakening quickly enough to keep inflation on target.

“Reasonable people might reasonably disagree about the risks,” Haskel said.

Last week the deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, said he thought inflation
may stay close to 25, Ibis now at 3.2%,

The rise in private sector activity above estimates by City economistsis a
double-edged sword for the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who would like to see

"Russia's war with Ukraine is stoking geopolitical tensions and damaging the
recovery prospects of the global economy, the head of the International
Monetary Fund has warned.

Kristalina Georgieva urged an end to the two-year conflict, saying it was both
a human tragedy and a barrier to growth.

As G7 finance ministers said they were looking at ways of using the almost
$300bn (€240bn) of seized Russian assets to help Ukraine, the IMF managing
director said support for Kyiv remained “steady and firm”. Georgieva said
Ukraine would need $42bn of financial support this year

The G7 group of leading developed countries said it would “continue working
on all possible avenues by which immobilised Russian sovereign assets could
be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with international law and our
respective legal systems”.

The communique released after the meeting in Washington also hinted at
tougher sanctions against Iran following last weekend's missile and drone
attack on Israel

“We will ensure close coordination of any future measure to diminish Iran's
ability to acquire, produce, or transfer weapons to support its destabilising,
regional activities.” the G7 said,

Most ofthe seized Russian assets are being held in Europe, and the European,
Central Bank is concerned that outright seizure would result in tit-for-tat
retaliation from Moscow and may contravene international law.

One idea being pursued is to pull forward the interest payments on frozen
Russian assets - estimated at between €3bn to €5bn (€2.6bn to £4.3bn) a year
-so that they can be used as collateral for loans or bonds to support Ukraine.

The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the G7 had reluctantly concluded that
the war in Ukraine was not going to end any time soon and would require a
longer term commitment.

Georgieva said the sooner the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza ended the
better it would be for the global economy.

“The war in Ukraine isa tragedy for its people. Having men, women and
children killed and wounded is a daily occurrence. We need to end this war
for their sake and for the sake of the world economy,” she said

Six months of fighting between Israel and Hamas had meant Gaza’s economy
had been “wiped out”, Georgieva said. “Eighty per cent of it is gone. The
West Bank has also been impacted.”

Speaking ata press conference at the IMF's spring meeting, Georgieva said:

"The Bank of England’s recent record of forecasting inflation and the path of
interest rates was undermined by out-of-date methods and a failure to
communicate clearly with the public, according to a bruising independent
assessment.

 

The report by the former US Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke said the
Bank spent much of its time attempting to justify its poor judgment rather
than admitting its failures and changing course.

Accusing the Bank of appearing to “at times suffer from excessive
incrementalism”, he said policymakers had raised rates slowly over the past
two years when inflation was already rising beyond normal levels.

Bernanke said the Bank relied on old software to process information and
failed to consult staff, who were often overworked and inexperienced,
leading to “significant shortcomings”.

Setting out 12 recommendations, Bernanke said the forecasting errors by the
Bank “were hardly unique” among central banks in the developed world.

The Bank of England was the first to react to rising inflation when it began
raising interest rates in December 2021, long before the US Federal Reserve or
the European Central Bank.

 

However, Bernanke's criticism centres on a resistance inside Threadneedle
Street to ramping up its efforts in the summer of 2022, when sanctions
against Russian oil and gas and a blockade of Ukrainian wheat after Moscow’s
invasion resulted in a dramatic rise in costs.

 

The Bank persisted with incremental increases in interest rates while other
central banks moved swiftly to raise the cost of borrowing with a view to
restrict spending and bringing inflation back to their target.

"‘The boss of the US bank JP Morgan has warned that the world could be facing
‘the most dangerous moment since the second world war, putting lives and
economic growth at risk.

In is annual letter to investors, Jamie Dimon said the world had been
“generally on a path to becoming stronger and safer” in recent years but had
suffered a major reversal in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine,

“When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will
have on the global economy,” Dimon said. “Recent events, however, may
very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since world war It- we
should not take them lightly.”

‘The Wall Street banking boss did not mention Israels assault on Gaza in
recent months, but said the “abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence
in the Middle East” had also “punctured many assumptions about the
direction of future safety and security, binging us to this pivotal time in
history”.

‘Ina wide-ranging letter to investors covering everything from politics and
artificial intelligence to interest rates, Dimon warned that the breakdown in
{international relations “may end up having virtually no effect on the world’s
‘economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor”.

He added: “The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle Fast could become
far worse and spread in unpredictable ways. Most important, the spectre of
‘nuclear weapons - probably still the greatest threat to mankind - hovers as
the ultimate decider, which should strike deep fear in all our hearts.

“The best protection starts with an unyielding resolve to do whatever we
‘need to do to maintain the strongest military on the planet -a commitment
‘that is well within our economic capability.”

It follows similar warnings from the International Monetary Fund, which in
December said the global economy was on the brink of a second cold war
that could “annihilate” progress made since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Gita Gopinath, the IMF's first deputy managing director, said atthe time that
the world was ata “turning point” as tensions mounted between the most
‘powerful nations, and that the accelerating fragmentation of the world
‘economy into regional power blocs ~ centred around the US and China ~
risked wiping out trillions of dollars in global output.

“If we descend into cold war two, knowing the costs, we may not see
‘mutually assured economic destruction. But we could see an annihilation of,
the gains from open trade,” she said.

Dimon warned that a surge in government spending - linked not only to
|higher military expenditure but also climate transition plans, healthcare
costs and shifting global supply chains - could lead to “stickier inflation and,
higher rates than markets expect”.

JP Morgan, he said, already had contingency plans in place for US interest
tates - which are now in a range of 5.25% to 5.59% to rise higher than 8%, or
fall as low as 2%.

"Consumer confidence is bouncing back in the UK, with people predicting a
brighter financial future for the first time in two years, NatWest has said.

Paul Thwaite, the bank's chief executive said easing price pressuresas
inflation comes down seemed tobe feeding through to the general public.
Headline consumer price inflation isstillabove the Bank of England's 2%
target at 3.2% but has fallen sharply froma peak of 1.1% in October 2022.
Natwest’s own economic forecast suggests inflation will fall to2.5%by the
end ofthis year.

“With inflation continuing to fall, and the Bank of England expected to start
cutting rates later in the year, people and families are feeling more confident
about their financial situation,” Thwaite said on Friday morning. “And for the
first time since August 2021, more consumers expect their position tobe
better in 12 months’ time.”

That was based on internal and external surveys monitored by banking,
bosses, he added.

Thwaite said there was still “uncertainty” over the UK’s economic trajectory.
However, inthe absence of particularly dismal forecasts, the banking group
was able to signal further confidence that most customers would be able to
repay their loans on time.

NatWest said it had put aside £93m to protect itself from potential defaults by
borrowers inthe first quarter. That compares with £70m during the same
Period in 2022 but is far lower than the £191m analysts had predicted.

“Of course, there are many different views, and the actual trajectory may be
different, especially given the considerable macro uncertainty in the UK and
overseas. Despite this, customers remain resilient and impairments are low”
Thuaite said.

Lower-than-predicted loan loss forecasts, as wellas a surprise rise in net
interest margins - which measure the difference between what is charged for
loans versus paid out to savers - to 2.05%, boosted NatWest shares.

Shares were up 4.6% on Friday to a 14-month high of 303p a share. It made
NatWest the top riser on the FTSE 100, and helped boost the blue chip index
toa newall-time high of 8,136.52 points in early trading.

That was despite a27% drop in pre-tax profits to £1.3bn inthe three months
toMarch. However, it hada tough act to follow, having reported a50% jump
in profits to£1.8bn during the same period lst year, aftera string of interest
rate increases by the Bank of England,

Since then, Thwaite said NatWest has been paying higher interest rates to
many savers, as well as tough competition for mortgage borrowers, just as
the housing market slowed.

"Australia’s overall budget balance is the second strongest among G20,
nations, behind only Canada, according to the International Monetary Fund’s
latest fiscal monitor.

The IMF's half-yearly update, released on Wednesday night, found
Australia’s overall budget balance came in at -0.9% of gross domestic product
in 2023, with only Canada’s budget position (-0.6%) faring better.

Australia has shot up the rankings in the latest data, having placed equal 14th
in 2021 and seventh in 2022, when it fared worse than countries such as
Korea, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, hailed
what they described as a “remarkable achievement” in Australia’s budget,
management since they took office. The balance includes the budgets of the
states and the commonwealth.

“Our responsible management is ensuring that fiscal policy is taking the
pressure off inflation when itis at its highest,” the ministers said.

“The Albanese government delivered Australia’s first surplus in 15 years in
2022-23, achieving a $100bn turnaround in the forecast inherited from the
former government. A second surplus in next month’s budget remains within
reach.”

"Oil is continuing to drop this morning, with Brent crude down 1% today at
$89.52 per barrel.

Having risen last week in anticipation that Iran would respond to the
bombing of its diplomatic complex in Syria two weeks ago, oil is now
retreating on relief that the damage was not worse.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says:

 

The situation remains fraught and, beyond the geopolitical and
humanitarian implications, a more widespread conflict in the Middle East
could see energy prices surge and unpick central banks’ careful efforts to bring
down inflation.

Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and asa hedge
against inflation.

Analysts say gold has been lifted by geopolitical tensions, with war in
Ukraine and the Middle East encouraging some traders to put money into
bullion.

Some central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves. with
China’s central bank purchased gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month
in March.

"The US workforce added 303,000 jobs last month, far more than expected
and the 3oth straight month of job gains in the US. The unemployment rate
dipped to 2.8%.

Joe Biden hailed the report as “a milestone in America’s comeback”.

“Three years ago, inherited an economy on the brink. With today’s report of
303,000 new jobs in March, we have passed the milestone of 15m jobs
created since I took office. That's 15 million more people who have the
dignity and respect that comes with a paycheck,"" he said.

Economists had expected the US to add 192,000 jobs for the month. Hiring
has remained surprisingly strong despite the Federal Reserve's attempts to
cool inflation by raising interest rates.

Over the last 16 months, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rates from.
neat zer0 to over 59. Hikes have been paused recently and the Fed chair,
Jerome Powell, said in March that the central bank would cut rates in
response to a perceived weakness in the jobs market. The next rate decision
isin May.

Inflation has cooled as rates have risen, The annual rate of price rises was
3.2% in February, down froma high of over 9% in June2022. And to the
surprise of many economists hiring has remained robust. Unemployment has
now been below 49% for two years, the longest such streak in decades and,
down from 6.7% when Biden took office.

Healthcare, government and construction led the gains and the labor
department reported that employment in leisure and hospitality returned to
pre-pandemic levels in February.

Wages rose by 0.3% from the previous month and were up 4.1% over the
year, the smallest gain since June 2021,

While the report was far stronger than expected, it once again highlighted
the racial disparities in the US jobs market. The Black unemployment rate
Tose 0.8% t0 6.4% its highest level since August 2022. Rates for Asians (2.5%)
and Hispanics (4.59) decreased while White unemployment was unchanged
303.4%.

The report is likely to bolster the Fed's reluctance to begin cutting rates soon.

“Reducing rates too soon or too much could result ina reversal in the
progress we've seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to
get inflation back to 2%,” Powell said this week at a business conference at
Stanford. “But easing policy too late or too litte could unduly weaken
economic activity and employment”

Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said
the “blockbuster” report “supports the Fed’s position that the resilience of
the economy means it can take its time with rate cuts, which might now not
begin until the second half of this year”.

In February 2024, non-farm employment in the US increased by a revised
270,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% from 3.7% the
month prior.

On Wednesday ADP, the country’s largest private payroll company, said US
businesses added 184,000 new positions in March, the largest rise since July
last year.
